Quasars are like the dinosaurs of the cosmos. These super bright objects were all over the place in the past, but they peaked and died out.

At first it seemed like quasars were a whole new class of object in space, beyond the galaxies we had observed at the time.

They are a special type of galaxy, one with a supermassive black hole at its center, with swirling disks of infalling matter, and enormous out-flowing jets.

According to wikipedia

"Quasar discovery surveys have shown that quasar activity was more common in the distant past; the peak epoch was approximately 10 billion years ago."

Let's take a look at those studies. 


What are quasars?




The age of the quasar, just like the dinosaur, is over.

At least, that's what the standard model of cosmology says. Let's dive in.

As I mentioned in a previous video, galaxies were discovered to exist beyond our Milky Way in the 1920's.

In the 1960's, these Quasar Stellar Objects, were found to exist beyond the galaxies.

By the 1980's we had found out that quasars are actually just galaxies with very bright central regions, called active galactic nuclei, or AGNs.

The real distinction between QSO and AGN is brightness, usually based on absolute magnitude.

Magnitude is one of those measures that is inverted, so the smaller the number, the brighter it is. This is often around magnitude of -24. 

While AGN are seen near and far, quasars are mostly seen around "cosmic noon", which is earlier than today in the universe's history, but not too early.



Quasars peaked about 10 billion years ago, which is a redshift of 2.

* z ~ 2, lcdm 68, 0.7, 0.3

If the universe has been around for 14 billion years, and we assume it will some day a trillion years old....

Then the quasars existed right here. and peaked right here, around z=2.. an dthen,  no more quasars 

If we lived over here, we wouldn't see
