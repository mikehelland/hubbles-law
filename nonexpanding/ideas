cat-mouse game age
The age of the universe and the age of stuff in it is a long running cat-and-mouse game. 

In the 1930's the estimated age of the universe was 2 billion years old. That's younger than the Earth, so that's a problem.

Skip ahead to 1995:

[INDENT][I]Is there a crisis in cosmology, or is it that the latest measurement of the Hubble constant is yet another of those numeri- cal disagreements that plague the field from time to time? That is the question inevitably prompted by last week's article by N.R. Tanvir et al.(Nature 377, 27-31; 1995). Their chief conclusion, based on the accurately known recession speed of the Coma cluster of galaxies, is that the Hubble constant ( otherwise H0) implies an age of the Universe much smaller than the known ages of the stars in glob- ular clusters in our Galaxy.[/I][/INDENT]

They value Tanvir comes up with 69.8 km/s/Mpc.

This was pre-dark energy though, so the age of the universe here is ΩΛ = 0.00, Ωm = 1.00, H0 = 69.80, age = 9.34 Gyr.

Along comes dark energy, and we get LCDM: ΩΛ = 0.685, Ωm = 0.315, H0 = 67.40, age = 13.79 Gyr.
