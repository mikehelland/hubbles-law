The real reason I don't believe in the big bang anymore, is
because it puts an infinite car an on a finite track.

Say you're gonna play a new go-kart game. But this is the best there ever was and ever will be.

You're car can go 1000 mph. It achevies top speed instantly! Max acceleration!

It handles flawlessly. It has power ups. It is the best thing imaginable of all time.

And tracks for this game?

Look look this.

That's right. 

Nothing.

The game is awesome. But yo uwoulnd't know it.

Because we know.

Cosmologists. Often in error. Never in doubt.
