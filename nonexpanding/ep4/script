In the last video we made this algorithm that calculates three distances in an expanding universe



We can understand those three distances by imagining two cars driving in opposite directions

And one honks their horn

We'll call the time of the horn honk t_honk.

And at this specific moment in time, we'll call the distance between the cars x_honk



But the other car won't hear the honk exactly at t_honk. The sound waves have to travel to the other car.

While the sound waves travel, so do the cars.



The sound waves reach the other car at time t_heard

And now the distance between the cars at time x_heard



Notice that the sound wave doesn't travel the full distance of x_heard

The sound wave left one car at t_honk and reached the other car at t_heard


The distance the sound traveled should be somewhere between x_honk and x_heard.

It will be the x of car 1 at t_honk - x car 2 at t_heard

It will also be the speed of sound times t_heard - t_honk 




So we have the distance between the cars at the time the horn was honked, the distance between them when the honk was heard

and also the actual distance the sound traveled.


This is why the distance to a galaxy in an expanding universe isn't just one simple distance. 

There is the distance to the galaxy when it emitted the light t_emit

There is the distance the galaxy has gotten to when that light was observed, t_observe, or t_now

And the distance the light actually traveled, c * (t_observe - t_emit)
