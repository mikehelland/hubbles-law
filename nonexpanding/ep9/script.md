Fixing Redshift


In the last episode I described a new theory to replaces the big bang and the expanding universe.

In this video, we're going to fix redshift.


Is redshift broken?

Well, not exactly. 

We use "z" to decribe the redshift, which is very non-linear, and it doesn't have to be.

Consider this time-line, from the present, back to the big bang, 13.8 billion years ago.

0 - 1- 2 -13.8

Now, at the present, is z=0, there is no redshift. And at the big bang, z=infinity. And here's how the rest of the numbers fit in.


This is how redshift z compares to it.

            1         2    5    10 20 infin


Rather than z, cosmologists often use a, which is the scale factor.

z is defined like this:

1 + z = w_obs / w_emit

a is defined by inverting the observed and emitted, and without the +1:

a = w_emit / w_obs

So a = 1/(1+z)

That looks like this:

1      05.    0.2


That's a little clearer. At least, it correlates to time more closely.

The scale factor and the time since the big bang don't line up quite exactly, because of how matter and dark energy change the expansion rate of the universe over time.

But I think we can do even better. 

And that's especially true in the alternative model of cosmology discussed in the last video.


First, we've been talking about redshift so far as a change in wavelength. 

Light also has frequency and energy, and its frequency and energy are directly related... and they are inversely related to wavelength.

So as light redshifts, its wavelength goes up, but it's frequency and energy are going down.

As the energy gets closer and closer to zero, the wavelength is going up and up toward infinity.

Doesn't it make more sense to think of in terms of its energy headed to zero, than its wavelength headed to infintiy?

If your bank account or gas tank were nearing empty, you'd be more concerned with it becoming zero, than its inverse becoming infinity.

As far as what's physically happening, the "decrease" is a better representation than the "increase". Or not. Let me know in the comments what you think about that.


With that said, we could talk about redshift not as how much wavelength is increasing, but by how much energy is decreasing.

For that we can use "r" for redshift, like this:

1 - r = a = 1/(1+z) = w_emit / w_obs

You might say "WHoaH!" r is for radius buddy.

But that's the beauty of it.

In the alternative model, the redshift r and radius r line up exactly.

If the energy we receive is half is what is expected, we would normally say the observed wavelength is twice what was expected,so z=1, because 1 + z = 2. 

Here r = 0.5, which means its energy is 50% the expected amount, and it's distanace is 50% of Hubble's length, c/H, or the radius of the observable universe (accoridng to the alterantive model). If c/H is about 14 billion light years, r = 0.5 is at a distance of 7 billion light years.

If r = 0.1, then we would say it's redshift-radus is 10%, it's missing 10% of the expected energy, and it's distance is 10% of c/H, so about 1.4 billion light years.
