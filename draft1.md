The Indefinite Universe: 

Part 1. Introduction

This is the tale of two speeds:

* the speed of light
* the speed of the expansion of space

But first, let's think about two dates.

* 1905
* 1920

And let's think about two universes.

* stars
* clumps of stars

Here's the deal.

In 1905, Einstein defined the speed of light as "c". Light would travel at *c* in a vacuum, and go on forever! To infinity and beyond. At the time the universe looked like this:

(points at stars)

It's all stars. That's the universe. According to people in 1905 and every year prior. 

Look out into space some night. How else could it be?

In 1920, Edwin Hubble had a cool microscope (not the one named after him), and he discovered something cool: galaxies.

The stars we see are just one clump of stars, and way far away from it, are other clumps of stars. The universe suddenly got much much MUCH bigger.

As Hubble explored the new world of galaxies, he found something else: as the galaxies become very distant, the frequency of their light decreases.

Let's recapp.

1905: the universe is the size of a single galaxy, light theoretically travels indefinitely through space never losing energy.

1920's: the universe is millions of times larger than a single galaxy, light actually travels millions of light years through space and loses energy

The energy of a photon is E = hf, which is its frequency times a constant.  A decrease in freqeuncy is a decrease in energy. The decrease in frequency is called "redshift", due to red being the lowest frequencies on the spectrum of visible light.

What to do about Redshift 

Approach 1. Expansion

The common way to address Hubble's redshift is to assume it is caused by the Doppler effect, which means the galaxies would have to be moving away from us, which ultimately means that space must be expanding.

With this approach, the two speeds we want are:

* the speed of light is c, to infinity and beyond
* the speed of the expansion of space is H (after Hubble) times D, the distance from us

The picture painted by these parameters is infinite light in a finite universe.

In this approach, nothing about light changes from 1905. It's the space that light moves through that has to work differently.

Approach 2. Light doesn't go forever

The redshift that we observe could actually be something that light does. In this case, the redshift indicates we could make changes to how light works, not space. To do that, we can just move the speed of the expansion of space over to the speed of light.

* the speed of light is c - HD
* the speed of the expansion of space is 0

The picture painted by these parameters is light that travels a finite distance, in a universe that stretches beyond the observable region indefinitely.

Light is emitted at c, and travels throughout the Milky Way at c, but as the light years stack up if it leaves our galaxy, it burns out at a speed of HD.




In the Milky Way which was a bunch of stars:

(all stars)

and there were this nebulae. Kinda different than stars, but kinda not.

Hubble and others showed that these nebula were actually groups of stars that were outside the group of stars that was the Milky Way.

So we went from space being filled with stars, to space being filled with clumps of stars.

Clumps of stars of course are galaxies.

Slide 2

* Redshift

The more galaxies that were looked at, and the more their distances were calculated, something weird showed up.

In 1905, when the universe was the Milky Way, the idea was that light would travel at *c*, forever.


was focusing his telescopes in on galaxies, groups of stars outside the Milky Way. And now the universe looks like this:

And the more galaxies he looked at




This is the big bang, where:

* speed of light is c
* expansion of space is HD

Finite universe, meaning finite space, finite time.

everything is finite, except for light

This is the indefinite universe, where:

* speed of light is c - Hd
* expansion of space is 0



c - Hd vs c - HD
c - Hd vs c - Ht
