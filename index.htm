<h1>Fixing Hubble's Law</h1>

<p>Finding the right value for Hubble's Constant <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=hubble+constant+crisis">has been difficult. </a>
</p>

<p>To understand why, imagine you have a laser, and you shoot a laser beam into space.</p>

<p>Now imagine the laser beam passes a series of targets you've placed in space, each 200 million light years apart.</p>

<p>In a simple universe, the laser beam will reach the first target in 200 million years, the second target in 400 million light years, and so on.</p>

<div id="staticModel"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("staticModel"),
        name: "Static",
        color: "red", 
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
        }
    })
</script>

<p>But we don't live in such a simple universe. We observe cosmological redshifts, which are interpreted as galaxies moving away from us in an expanding universe.</p>

<p>The question is then, how fast is the universe expanding?</p>

<p>Based on observations, a target that begins 13.8 billion light years away would be 46.6 billion light years away by the time the laser beam caught up with it. 
    Also, a target that started 5.5 billion light years away would be 11 billion light years away when the laser beam got to it.
    Those are the white points on the graph.</p>

<p>If Hubble's Law is v = H &times; D, where v is the apparent recessional velocity of the target, H is Hubble's Constant, and D is the comoving distance of the target, then what should H be?</p>

<p>If H is 90 light years per million light years, the near-by data point can be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingFast"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("expandingFast"),
        name: "Expanding Fast",
        color: "orange", 
        H: 0.00009,
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
            for (var i = 0; i < this.targets.length; i++) {
                this.targets[i].x += this.targets[i].start * this.H
            }
        }
    })
</script>

<p>If H is 51 light years per million light years, the far data point can be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingSlow"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("expandingSlow"),
        name: "Expanding Slow",
        color: "blue", 
        H: 0.000051,
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
            for (var i = 0; i < this.targets.length; i++) {
                this.targets[i].x += this.targets[i].start * this.H
            }
        }
    })
</script>

<p>There isn't a single value for H that can be used in this model to reach both data points.</p>

<p>The problem isn't really Hubble's Constant, it's the interpretation of redshift and the version of Hubble's Law being used.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble said that it was convienent for the redshift to be interpreted as a Doppler-like effect, leading to the expanding universe theory. 
    He said the redshfits might also be interpreted as how nature actually works: 
    there isn't another phenomenon causing the redshifts; the redshifts are a new phenomenon in themselves. 
    However, he noted, if there are existing ways to explain the redshift, adding new princinples of nature should be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>When first observed the red-shifts were immediately attributed to radial motion away from the observer, to recession of the nebulae. 
    This interpretation still remains the only permissible explanation that is known. 
    It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would 
    be conspicuous and, actually, are not found. 
    We may state with some confidence that <b>red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle of nature.</b>
    We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, 
    familiar principle by an ad hoc explanation <b>unless we are forced to that step by actual observations.</b>

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 22, 1937 (emphsis added)
</blockquote>
    

<p>But the path of the familiar principles has lead us to propose new principles anyways: accelerating expansion, dark energy, the inflation period, the multiverse. 
    We are clearly past the point of being forced to create new principles of physics.</p>

<p>Therefore, consider a literal interpretation of the law of redshifts:</p>

<blockquote>the law of red-shfts - the observed fact that light from a distant galaxy loses energy proportionally to the distance of the galaxy. 
    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 18, 1937
</blockquote>

<p>I've devised two hypotheses based on a literal interpretation of the redshifts to test.</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 1: the speed of light = c - H &times; D</b></p>

<div id="redshift1"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("redshift1"),
        name: "Redshift by distance",
        color: "green", 
        H: 0.000072,
        photon: {x: 0, dx: c},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c - this.H * this.photon.x
        }
    })
</script>

<p><b>Hypothesis 2: the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)</b></p>

<div id="redshift2"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("redshift2"),
        name: "Redshift by distance 2",
        color: "magenta", 
        H: 0.00035,
        photon: {x: 0, dx: c},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c / (1 + this.H * this.photon.x)
            
            // not needed, used for logging purposes
            this.photon.dx = c / (1 + this.H * this.photon.x)
        }
    })
</script>

<p>Note that Hypothesis 2 hits both data points.</p>

<p>In these models, the laser beam's speed diminishes as its distance from its source increases. The speed of a wave is its frequency &times; wavelength. 
    And the energy of a photon is its frequency &times; Planck's constant. We observe redshifts, which are drop in frequency and energy. 
    Taken literally, that would also drop the laser beam's speed.</p>

<p>From this data and the models considered, Hypothesis 2 appears to be the real Hubble's Law. In such a universe, space is not expanding, there is no dark energy, 
    there is no age or size of the universe, and Hubble's Constant is a consistent 0.00035 million light years per million years. </p>

<p>Hubble's Law should be:</p>

<blockquote>the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)</blockquote>

<p>
    This conclusion raises questions that must be addressed that include:
    <ul>
        <li>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</li>
        <li>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</li>
        <li>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light Theory?</li>
        <li>What about the Cosmic Microwave Background?</li>
        <li>... more to come as questions come in</li>
    </ul>
    These are addressed below.
</p>

<hr>

<h4>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</h4>

<p>Yes, when light has traveled for millions of years, its speed will be less than c.</p>

<p>But our experiments and measurements don't last millions of years. In our experiments, H &times; D is so small, it can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So if:</p>

<pre>
    v_light = c / (1 + H &times; D)
    
    and:
    
    H &times; D = 0
    
    then:
    
    v_light = c / (1 + 0)
    
    v_light = c
</pre>

<p>In which case there shouldn't be any conflict with special relativity in the domain where the redshifts don't appear.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</h4>

<p>The task would be to come up with a clever way to measure the speed of ancient light without disturbing the photon.</p>

<p>Say that light travels for hundreds of millions of years, and slows to below c, and then hits your telescope's lens.</p>

<p>At the quantum level, the photon will have been <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod5.html">absorbed by atoms</a> in the lens. 
    Then a new photon, or maybe the old one, is emitted and focused to your telescope's eyepiece.</p>

<p>The photon may have traveled great distances from its source before it encountered your telescope, 
    but the light inside the telescope will be very close to its source: the lens that focused it. 
    The D of the photons in the telescope will not be millions of light years, but rather a few dozen centimeters.</p>

<p>Thus, any light that we interact with will presumably be moving at c / (1 + H &times; 0), or just c.</p>

<p>If there was a way to measure the speed of ancient light without interacting with it, that would make a good test of the hypothesis. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</h4>

<p>In the specific model demonstrated here, yes, energy is lost. 
    It could be that the energy deducted from the photon is deposited in space as it travels. </p>

<p>But I will let the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a> do the talking on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
    The thing about photons is that they redshift, losing energy as space expands. 
    If we keep track of a certain fixed number of photons, the number stays constant while the energy per photon decreases, 
    so the total energy decreases. A decrease in energy is just as much a “violation of energy conservation” as an increase in energy, 
    but it doesn’t seem to bother people as much. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how bothersome it is, of course — it’s a 
    crystal-clear prediction of general relativity.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/">https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In an expanding universe, photons redshift and energy is lost.</p>

<p>Under the literal interpretation of redshifts, however, energy is lost or it might be deposited throughout space. 
    The photon could simply decay into tiny particles left in its path after 14 billion years.</p>

<p>Either way, if lost energy is an issue, then the expanding universe theory has the same issue.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light Theory?</h4>

<p>In 1929, just after Hubble published the redshift-distance relation, Fritz Zwicky proposed a type of gravitational drag was causing the redshift, 
    not an expanding universe. </p>

<p>However, such an effect would lead to a blurring of the light, which is not observed. Referring to an earlier quote, as Hubble said in 1937:</p>

<blockquote>
    It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would 
    be conspicuous and, actually, are not found.
    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 22, 1937 
</blockquote>

<p>In Hypothesis 1 and 2, under the literal interpretation of redshift, light does figuratively "get tired", but not because space expands, or the intergalactic medium, 
    or matter dragging on it. Redshifts are observed, and they are interpreted as their own phenomena in nature. </p>

<p>In Zwicky's Tired Light model, light loses energy but still travels at c. 
    This is represented by the red dots in the graph, a static universe with a universally constant speed of light. 
    This model does not connect the two data points aimed for.</p>

<p>The hypotheses presented here, represented by the green and magenta dots in the graph, are mathematially distinct from Zwicky's Tired Light. 
    The magenta line does connect the desired data points, which no other interpretation can claim.</p>

<p>So this is not Zwicky's Tired Light Theory. This is an even more literal interpretation of redshift and a novel mathematical model.</p>

<hr>

<h4>What about the Cosmic Microwave Background?</h4>

<p>The CMB is a major topic in cosmology and will be getting its own article. Soon.</p>
