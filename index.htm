        <h2>Cosmological Redshift and Time Dilation</h2>

        <p>
            A model of time dilating photons in static space is shown to match the travel times and redshifts 
            produced by a model of expanding space.
            This model can be easily adapted to match the observed acceleration of redshifts with zero additional parameters.
            This results in a new redshift-distance relation with a constant that has units that differ from Hubble's constant.
            Testing the hypothesis is presently feasible and would yield working practical technology 
            if confirmed.</p>

            <h3>Introduction</h3>

            <p>Current measurements of the expansion rate of the universe don't agree[1][2][3][4], and hundreds of solutions have been proposed[5]. 
                The hypothesis proposed here is that space does not expand between galaxies, but time does.
                The idea is first introduced in a non-relativistic universe with a linear expansion rate.
                Second, the hypothesis is shown to lend itself to variations, one of which matches the observations of an accelerating universe.
                Third, a discussion of the hypothesis in a relativistic universe.</p>

        <h3>Expanding Space</h3>

        <p>To understand the hypothesis, let's first make a basic model of expanding space.</p> 

        <p>
            Due to the expansion of space, it will take a photon longer than 100 million years (My) to reach a galaxy that is presently 100 million light years (Mly) away.
            The increase in travel time is accompanied with a decrease in energy called cosmological redshift.
            To compute the time delays and redshifts, a computer model is used that places a series of targets 100 Mly apart. 
            A photon is emitted when the model starts, and the time is logged when the photon reaches a target. Everything in the model is moving away 
            from the photon's source according to Hubble's law, v=H<sub>0</sub>D. This stretches the wavelength of the photon, allowing us to calculate the redshift (z)
            using (wavelength_observed - wavelength_original) / wavelength_original.
        </p>
        
        <p>The timestep for the program is 1 My, and the speed of light is 1 Mly/My.
            The value used here for H<sub>0</sub> (variable "H0" in the code) is 74 km/s/Mpc, the often cited SH0ES team measurement. 
            This is first converted to km/s/Mly, or 22.69 km/s/Mly. This is then converted to Mly/My/Mly so 
            it fits with the units of time and the natural units of the speed of light used, which is 
            0.0000756 Mly/My/Mly. 
        </p>

            The time it takes to reach a target in expanding space is shown in white in Figure 1. The blue line 
            shows the time to the target without the expansion of space.
            The redshifts are shown in Figure 2.

        <h3>Expanding Time</h3>

        <p>
            Now let's compare that to a model with the same time delays, but where the distance between galaxies does not increase.
            In such a model, the photon's experience of time will deviate from the master clock of the non-relativistic model. 
            (In a relativistic universe, the photon does not experience time, which will be discussed in a later section.) For now, we will consider the photon to have a clock 
            that begins synchronized with the model's master clock and gradually falls behind by some constant. 
            For this to work, the constant involved cannot have the same units as Hubble's constant, H<sub>0</sub>. To show that this is not the traditional Hubble's constant,
            H<sub>0</sub>, the subscript 0 is dropped and the constant is referred to only as H. Here H will have the units of years per million light years.
        </p>

        <p>In this model, the photon experiences a time interval of &#916;t' that is a function of its distance D:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <img src="img/eq-dt=dt-HD.png">
        </blockquote>

        <p>Here &#916;t represents the time interval that passes on the master clock, and H=0.0000756 My/Mly. When H is multiplied by D in Mly, the Mly cancel out.
            For D=1 Mly, HD=0.0000756 My, which is subtracted from the model's timestep, &#916;t, of 1 My, resulting in &#916;t'.</p>
            
        <p>The photon then advances at c for a time of &#916;t':</p>

        <blockquote>
        <img src="img/eq-dx=cdt.png">
        </blockquote>

        <p>The photon will still move at c, according to the time that it thinks has passed. But the photon is actually moving at less than c compared to the time 
            that passes on the master clock.
            The photon will also oscillate at its original frequency compared to the time it thinks has passed. For an original frequency &nu; and original wavelength 
            &lambda;, the new frequency &nu;' is: 
        </p>

        <blockquote>
        <img src="img/eq-nu.png">
        </blockquote>

        <p>To the photon, it is oscillating at its original frequency and traveling at c. But to the master clock, which hasn't slowed down,
            the photon will be oscillating at a lower frequency and traveling at less than c. Comparing the original frequency and the observed frequency,
            gives us the redshift (z).

        <p>Using the same value for H as we did for H0 in the previous code (but using different units) produces the same
            time delays and redshifts as the model of expanding space, as shown in Figures 3. and 4.
        </p>

        <h3>Accelerating Redshifts</h3>
        
        <p>
        Modern measurements of redshifts and distances differ from the predictions of the basic expanding models in the previous section.
        The current expansion rate seems to be faster than it was in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
        The expanding time model in the previous section was meant to identically mimic Hubble's law.
        If Hubble's law needs extra parameters, such as dark energy, to fit the modern observational data,
        then identically mimicking Hubble's law is no longer necessary. 
        </p>

        <p>
            A photon in the linearly expanding time model experiences a time interval of &#916;t - HD.
            Since the expanding time model is no longer restricted by a linear Hubble's law, 
            other forms can be explored. For example, we can divide &#916;t by 1 + HD, rather than subtract, and get the same basic effect as D increases. 
        </p>

        <p>
        In the form of 1 + HD, the constant H must have the units of inverse distance. To make this more intuitive, we're going to break with the tradition 
        of multiplying distance by a constant, and instead divide distance by a constant, giving us 1 + D/H and giving the constant H units of distance.
        </p>

        <p>
        By putting variations on a theme, I devised similar but different mathematical models to compare:
        </p>

        <table>
        <tr><td> hypothesis 1: </td> <td><img src="img/eq-dt=dt-HD.png" alt="dt' = dt - HD"></td></tr>
        <tr><td> hypothesis 2: </td> <td><img src="img/eq-dt-inverse.png" alt="dt' = dt / (1 + D/H)"></td></tr>
        <tr><td> hypothesis 3: </td> <td><img src="img/eq-dt-inverse_square.png" alt="dt' = dt / (1 + D/H)^2"></td></tr>
        <tr><td> hypothesis 4: </td> <td><img src="img/eq-dt-inverse_square2.png" alt="dt' = dt / (1 + (D/H)^2)"></td></tr>
        </table>


        <p>
            The next step was to compare these hypotheses against the observational data. For that I used the <a href="http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/figures/SCPUnion2.1_mu_vs_z.txt">Supernovae Cosmology Project's data</a>. I converted the distance modulus to co-moving distance, and ran models for the hypotheses and showed the results against the observational data. The code for this is at the bottom of this document. The inverse square variation, hypothesis 3, is a very good fit of the data, for H=25 Gly. 
        </p>


        <p class="pimg">

            Hypothesis 3, H=25 Gly (red), Hypothesis 4, H=3.8 Gly (orange)
        </p>

        <p>Try it: use your own values for H on the <a href="test.htm">testing page</a> and the <a href="other/supernovae.htm">supernovae testing page</a>.</p>

        <h3>A New Redshift-Distance Relation</h3>

        <p>Whether or not the interpretation of redshifts proposed here is considered possible or necessary, because it fits the acceleration 
            of the redshifts, it can be used as an accurate predictor of z and distance given one or the other. The hypothesis is:
        </p> 

        <blockquote>
            <img src="img/eq-dt-inverse_square.png" alt="dt' = dt / (1 + D/H)^2">
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        When used to calculate redshifts, the standard pattern arises that at z=1, &#916;t'=0.5&#916;t, and at z=2, &#916;t'=0.333&#916;t, and so on, such that:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <img src="img/rd-2.png" >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Therefore:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <img src="img/rd-3.png" >
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/rd-4.png" >
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/rd-5.png" >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Solving for D we get:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <img src="img/rd-6.png" >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        And solving for z we get:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            <img src="img/rd-7.png" >
            <br><br>
            <img src="img/rd-8.png" >
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        These formulas predict the observed z and D of a galaxy in an expanding universe that is accelerating.
        </p>
        
        <h3>The Geometry of Spacetime</h3>
        
        <p>In a relativistic universe, every observer has their own clock, and so does every object. 
            The photon, however, is said not to experience time. It must follow a light-like path, the null geodesic. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In this hypothesis, either cosmologically redshifted photons veer off the null geodesic in a time-like direction, or the geometry of spacetime 
            changes at cosmological scales without changing in size. 
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/lightcones.png" width="500">
            <br>
            Blue: basic spacetime, Green: hypothesis 1, Red: hypothesis 3
        </p>
        
        <p>In a basic spacetime, all the photon geodesics will be parallel or perpendicular, shown left in the image below. What's proposed here is that every point in spacetime 
            is the beginning of a new geodesic whose trajectory depends on the distance from the starting point. As a consequence, the geometry of spacetime 
            would change to something more like the image on the right.
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/geometry_compare.png" >
        
        <p>
            A photon begins on a null geodesic, traveling at c, with its clock standing still. As it travels cosmological distances,
            its clock moves, and it experiences time, very slowly, when compared to observer clocks.  
        </p>

        <h3>Observational Cosmology</h3>

        <a name="cmb"></a>
        <details id="a_cmb">

            <summary>The CMB indicates a hot past</summary>

            <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background was predicted by the big bang theory
                as a remnant of the fiery conditions at the beginning of the universe, and its discovery is an important piece of evidence for the theory. </p>
        
            <p>If the decelerating photon hypothesis is correct, the CMB must have some other explanation. Consider the following facts:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Photons lose energy with distance</li>
                <li>There is energy coming from all directions as microwave background radiation</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>The energy lost through redshifting and the energy of the CMB might be more closely related than we currently think.
                What happens to the energy a photon loses when it redshifts? It has to go somewhere.
                If the energy lost by redshifting is discarded into space it would start to pile up.</p>
        
            <p>If space is filling up with the energy discarded by redshifting photons,
                when the energy in a volume of space is greater than the energy equivalent of 
                the temperature of its surroundings, that volume of space should start emitting radiation to cool to equilibrium.
            </p>
        
            <p>This might take the form of a "background" field that receives the energy lost by redshifting photons 
                and returns the energy to the EM field as photons to reach a thermal equilibrium.</p>
            
            <p>Early 20th century astronomers calculated that the minimum temperature to which a black body in our galaxy
                would cool is about 3 K 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Timeline_of_prediction,_discovery_and_interpretation">
                    well before the CMB was discovered</a>.</p>
        
            <!--<p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmb_predictions.png"></p>-->
        
            <p>The CMB was discovered in 1964 at 3 K, which has been refined to around 2.7 K.
        
            <p>In the expanding model, the similarity between the predicted effective temperature of our galaxy and the temperature
                of the CMB is a coincidence.</p> 
        
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, the temperature of the CMB is an effect of the 
                background field cooling to the effective temperature of the galaxy.

            <summary>The farthest galaxies are younger than nearby galaxies, indicating a beginning of time</summary>

            <p>A universe that begins with a big bang should contain younger and younger galaxies as we look back in space and time.
                As we've been getting a better look at the universe, we are finding that the distant universe isn't meeting our expectations
                for when galaxies become massive, dusty, spiraled, barred, disced, bulged, and have shut down star formation:</p>

                        (∼12.5 billion years ago) (see the figure). This finding suggests that the processes that generate the key features of a mature galaxy arose more rapidly than 
                        has been thought.

            <summary>The Tolman surface brightness test indicates an expanding universe</summary>


            <p>The Tolman Surface Brightness Test is meant to distinguish a static universe from an expanding one.</p>

            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, a photon experiences the same delays in the journey as a photon would in expanding space. 
                But successive photons in an expanding universe would experience higher delays, whereas each successive photon in the decelerating photon hypothesis
                experiences the same delay as the first photon.</p>

            <!--<p>You can see this in action on the <a href="freqtest.htm">Photon Arrival Rate page</a></p>-->

            <p>An expanding universe predicts an extra factor of dimming, due to the photons arriving at a lower rate due to the galaxy's motion away from us.
                Based on observations, it predicts one factor too many<sup>[25]</sup>:

            <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis predicts one fewer factor than the expanding universe, matching observations.</p>

            <summary>Time dilation in supernovae light curves indicate an expanding universe</summary>

            <p>Due to the expanding universe, a nearby event that lasts for 20 days, such as a supernova, would appear to last longer when the event takes place far away.
                That is because of the same reason that an expanding universe predicts a fourth dimming factor in the surface brightness test: the galaxy is 
                farther away each time it emits light.
                This is known as time dilation, and it is observed in the light curves of distant supernovae. 
                The more dilated the duration of the event, the farther away it must be.
            </p>
        
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, space is not expanding, and thus it cannot stretch the time it takes for an event to occur. The only way
                the decelerating photon hypothesis could be true then, is if the longer supernovae observed are not time dilated, but actually much bigger supernovae than we
                assume they are.</p>
        
            <p>This is the position argued by Jensen<sup>[26]</sup>, page 5:</p>
        
            <blockquote>On the other hand, the Delta(15) values seem to indicate the opposite trend, the
                light curves and therefore the supernovae themselves are actually getting smaller with increasing
                redshift! Why would this be true? Why would we find smaller supernova with increasing
                redshift? Unless the morphology of supernova are changing, and the spectra indicate that they are
                not, we should expect the size of the supernova we actually observe to increase slightly with
                distance, a predictable Malmquist type II bias of about 4%.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>And page 6:</p>
        
            <blockquote>
                This same argument can be made with the most basic piece of statistical data: Supernovae rise
                    times: In the local universe, the average rise time is 20 days, but in the redshifted universe; it is
                    17.5 days, which again, would tend to indicate more distant supernova are smaller (Li). If this
                    time dilation factor is removed, the high redshift sample has an average rise time of about 25
                    days. This is too long for normal Ia, but not if the distance modulus and
                    the corresponding attenuation factor are underestimated. In this case, the higher redshifted SNe Ia
                    would indeed be over-represented by very high magnitude ‘peculiar’ Ia, or hypernova. Credence
                    is given to this conjecture by the fact the number of supernova actually found in high redshift
                    surveys represent only a small fraction (~4%) of the expected yield (Tonry).
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>Jensen argues that the farther we look into space and the larger our sample size becomes, the smaller the average supernova appears to be, contrary 
                to expectations. 
                He advocates adjusting for a Malmquist type II bias, meaning the farther into space we look,
                the lower the fraction of the galaxy's light will reach us, altering our measurements. 
                These particularly long lasting supernovae are then 
                not only larger events than we think they are, they are also farther away than we think.</p>

        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <p>In addition to a simple alternative to dark energy, the hypothesis offers several other advantages. 
            Observations have shown that redshifts might be quantized.
            And the expansion of the universe may differ for light of different wavelengths. If redshifts are caused by space expanding, 
            these would be downright impossible. 
        </p>

        
        
        <p>
            A decelerating photon, if it redshifts in a quantum event, would cause quantized redshifts. And if that might differ slightly 
            for different wavelengths, those features could easily be accommodated too.
        </p>-->

        

        <hr>
        <h3>Tests and Applications</h3>

        <p>It is important to keep in mind that interacting with a cosmologically redshifted photon will, according to the hypothesis, reset it's D to zero, causing it to 
            behave as a normal photon. With that in mind, several good tests for this hypothesis can be made where the redshifted light is 
            not disturbed until the end of the experiment.
        </p> 

        <p>
            If ancient photons are experiencing time differently, and appear to have decelerated in our frame of reference, a simple test could be devised using existing technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Launch a probe that scans for supernovae, and send it out past Mars. When it detects a supernova in the opposite direction of Earth, 
            send a signal back to us with its location.
        </p>

        <p>If all the photons involved are moving at c, the signal from the probe should reach Earth at the same time as the supernova.
        </p>

        <p>If the decelerating photon hypothesis is correct, the signal from the probe to Earth should travel at c and reach
            us sooner than the slow light from the distant supernova.
        </p>

        <p>If confirmed, such a test would provide a working technology for astronomers to apply immediately to get advanced warnings
            on Earth about events such as supernovae.
        </p>

        <p>Furthermore, using the distant probe we can calculate the speed of the supernova's light, being able to produce a distance measurement 
            free from the influence of peculiar velocity.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>


    <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis changes the physics of light at cosmological distances to accommodate the redshifts.
        On the other hand, the expanding interpretation of redshifts has led to a change in just about everything in the universe except for light.
    </p>
        
    <p>When interpreting the redshifts as Doppler effects in the early 20th century, astronomers did so because it  
        was known and familiar and didn't require new laws of physics.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        We may state with some confidence that red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle  of nature. 
        We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, familiar principle by an 
        ad hoc explanation unless we are forced to that step by  actual observations. 
        - 
        <span style="font-style: normal !important">Edwin Hubble</span>

    </blockquote>

    <p>The observed acceleration of the redshifts has forced us to that step.</p>

    <p>
        If dark energy is in the consideration as a possible fundamental ingredient of nature, 
        then the observed phenomenon of cosmological redshift, the actual observations that lead to dark energy, should be considered as well.</p>
