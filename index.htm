<h1>Fixing Hubble's Law</h1>

<p>Finding the right value for Hubble's Constant <a href="https://www.livescience.com/hubble-constant-crisis-deepens.html">has been difficult. </a>
</p>

<p>To understand why, imagine you have a laser, and you shoot a laser beam into space.</p>

<p>Now imagine the laser beam passes a series of targets you've placed in space, each 200 million light years apart.</p>

<p>In a simple universe, the laser beam will reach the first target in 200 million years, the second target in 400 million light years, and so on.</p>

<div id="staticModel"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("staticModel"),
        name: "Static",
        color: "red", 
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
        }
    })
</script>

<p>But we don't live in such a simple universe. We have the law of redshifts, which are interpreted as galaxies moving away from us in an expanding universe.</p>

<p>The question is then, how fast is the universe expanding?</p>

<p>Based on observations, a target that begins 13.8 billion light years away would be 46.6 billion light years away by the time the laser beam caught up with it.</p>

<p>Also, a target that started 5.5 billion light years away would be 11 billion light years away when the laser beam got to it.</p>

<p>Those are the white points on the graph.</p>

<p>If Hubble's Law is v = H &times; D, where v is the apparent recessional velocity of the target, H is Hubble's Constant, and D is the comoving distance of the target, then what should H be?</p>

<p>If H is 90 light years per million light years, the near by data point an be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingFast"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("expandingFast"),
        name: "Expanding Fast",
        color: "#AAAABB", 
        H: 0.00009,
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
            for (var i = 0; i < this.targets.length; i++) {
                this.targets[i].x += this.targets[i].start * this.H
            }
        }
    })
</script>

<p>If H is 51 light years per million light years, the far data point can be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingSlow"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("expandingSlow"),
        name: "Expanding Slow",
        color: "#8888BB", 
        H: 0.000051,
        photon: {x: 0},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += c
            for (var i = 0; i < this.targets.length; i++) {
                this.targets[i].x += this.targets[i].start * this.H
            }
        }
    })
</script>

<p>The problem isn't really Hubble's Constant, it's the interpretation of redshift and the version of Hubble's Law being used.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble said that it was conveinent for the redshift to be interpreted as a Doppler-like effect, leading to the expanding universe theory. 
    He said the redshfits might also be interpreted as how nature actually works: 
    there isn't another phenomenon causing the redshifts; the redshifts are a new phenomenon in themselves. 
    However, he noted, if there are existing ways to explain the redshift, adding new princinples of nature should be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>When first observed the red-shifts were immediately attributed to radial motion away from the observer, to recession of the nebulae. 
    This interpretation still remains the only permissible explanation that is known. 
    It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would 
    be conspicuous and, actually, are not found. 
    We may state with some confidence that <b>red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle of nature.</b>
    We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, 
    familiar principle by an ad hoc explanation <b>unless we are forced to that step by actual observations.</b>

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 22, 1937 (emphsis added)
</blockquote>
    

<p>But the path of the familiar principles has lead us to propose new principles anyways: accelerating expansion, dark energy, the inflation period, the multiverse. We're past the point of being forced to that step of creating new principles of physics.</p>

<p>Therefore, consider two hypotheses based on a literal interpretation of the law of redshifts:</p>

<blockquote>the law of red-shfts - the observed fact that light from a distant galaxy loses energy proportionally to the distance of the galaxy.

</blockquote>

<p>I've devised two hyptheses based on the literal interpretation of the law of redshifts to test.</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 1: the speed of light equals c - H &times; D</b></p>

<div id="redshift1"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("redshift1"),
        name: "Redshift by distance",
        color: "green", 
        H: 0.000072,
        photon: {x: 0, dx: c},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += this.photon.dx
            this.photon.dx = c - this.H * this.photon.x
        }
    })
</script>

<p><b>Hypothesis 2: the speed of light equals c / (1 - H &times; D)</b></p>

<div id="redshift2"></div>
<script>
    setupModel({
        div: document.getElementById("redshift2"),
        name: "Redshift by distance 2",
        color: "magenta", 
        H: 0.00035,
        photon: {x: 0, dx: c},
        next: function () {
            this.photon.x += this.photon.dx
            this.photon.dx = c / (1 + this.H * this.photon.x) 
        }
    })
</script>

<p>Note here that Hypothesis 2 hits both data points.</p>

<p>From this data and the models considered, Hypothesis 2 appears to be the real Hubble's Law. In such a universe, space is not expanding, there is no dark energy, 
    there is no age or size of the universe, and Hubble's Constant is a consistent 0.00035 million light years per million years. </p>

<p>Hubble's Law is:</p>

<blockquote>the speed of light = c / (1 - H &times; D)</blockquote>

    This conclusion has consequences that must be addressed that included:
    <ul>
        <li>relativity</li>
        <li>quantum mechanics</li>
        <li>the cosmic microwave background</li>
        <li>... much more</li>
    </ul>
    These will be addressed one by one, with links updated here.
