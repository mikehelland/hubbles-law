        <h2>Observation</h2>

            <p>
                Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), is the expansion rate of the universe. The most direct pieces of evidence for the expansion of space are the 
                redshifts in light from distant galaxies, and the time dilation of distant supernovae. Light is redshifted
                when its wavelength increases, and time dilation is an increase in duration. 
                So the observations include a stretching of length, and a stretching of time. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingspace"></canvas></p>

            <p>Light, an electromagnetic wave, would also be redshifted were the wave's period to increase somehow. Since the observed duraton of a 
                distant supernovae is stretched, then it would follow that the duration of all similarly distant phenomena would be equally stretched, 
                including the oscillations of electromagnetic waves emitted from that distance.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider the interpretation that the observed redshifts are a change in the electromagnetic wave's period. 
                The evidence could then be stated as: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The elongated period of an electromagnetic wave</li>
                <li>The elongated duration of supernovae</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingtime"></canvas></p>

            <p>
                As a consequence of interpretting redshift like this, the two points of evidence appear fundamentally one-in-the-same, 
                with the suggestive hint that it has to do with some kind of dynamic of time, rather than of space.
            </p>

            <h2>Conjecture</h2>

            <p>
                The time dilation of supernovae is traditionally considered to be an effect of the expansion of space. Each photon coming from the supernova will 
                have to travel farther than the one before it, causing its observed duraton to be stretched.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis developed in this paper asks the reader to consider the possibility that what we are observing to happen, is actually happening. 
                Distant supernovae don't just appear time dilated; they are time dilated. The observed time dilation isn't an effect of expanding space, because 
                the expansion of space won't be necessary in a universe with time that possesses this dynamic characteristic.
                The conjecture can be summarized as <b>"the past is time dilated"</b>. 
            </p>

            <script src="other/evidence.js"></script>

            <p>
                The next sections describe two attempts at developing this conjecture into a testable hypothesis. First in a purely ad hoc way, and then 
                with a geometrical foundation.
            </p>

            <h2>An ad hoc hypothesis</h2>

            <p>
                The scale factor \(a(t)\) plays a very important role in describing an expanding universe. 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) \]
            </p>


            <p>A length \(L\) in the past is its 
                current length times the scale factor: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[a(t) = \frac{L_{then}}{L_{now}} = \frac{\lambda_{emit}}{\lambda_{obs}} = \frac{1}{1+z}   \]
            </p>

            <p>
                And in a universe that expands very simply, such as a dark energy only universe: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[a(t) = e^{H_0t} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider what happens when a scale factor is applied to time instead of space.  
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - b(t)^2 c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The "time scale factor", \(b(t)\), describes the relationship between a duration \(T\) in the past and how it would 
                be observed in the present. 
                Given that frequency is the inverse of peroid: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[b(t) = \frac{T_{then}}{T_{now}} = \frac{f_{obs}}{f_{emit}} = \frac{1}{1+z}   \]
            </p>

            <p>
                And we'll use the same function to evalue the time scale factor as we would in a simply expanding universe. 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[b(t) = e^{H_0t}  \]
            </p>

            <p>
                This metric form has no curvature and amounts to a transformation of the time coordinate in Minkowski spacetime. It cannot be 
                claimed to produce the effects of time dilation, or explain why it happens, which is why a geometrical solution 
                is pursued in the next section. For now, we just need to assume that the time dilation that is observed is really happening,
                and that the \(t\) coordinate measured by an observer shows those effects. Under those assumptions, we can use the following transformation
                to produce a time coordinate \(\tau\) that excludes the effects of time dilation: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = \frac{1}{H_0} ( e^{H_0t} - 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to note that \(t = 0 \) will always represent the present, and that all the measured time 
                coordinates used will be negative since cosmological observations are dealing with the past. Therefore \(\tau \leq 0 \) too.
                This means the exponent in the equation should always be zero or negative.
            </p>

            <p>
                Distances, on the other hand, should be regarded as positive values. 
                Since \(\tau \) gives us the "un-time dilated" time coordinate, we know that the physical distance \(d\) 
                to a source of light is \(d = -c\tau \). The time scale factor in terms of redshift z can be substituted into the transformation, giving:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = (\frac{1}{1+z} - 1) \frac{1}{H_0}\]
                \[ \tau = -\frac{z}{1+z} \frac{1}{H_0}  \]
                \[ d = \frac{z}{1+z} \frac{c}{H_0} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The light travel time distance, \(d_t = -ct \), will be longer than the physical distance due to the effects of time dilation, and 
                can be related to z by reversing the time transformation:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = e^{H_0t} \]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(H_0\tau + 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                And due to the time scale factor's relationship with redshift:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = \frac{1}{1+z} \]
                \[ H_0\tau = \frac{1}{1+z} - 1\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(\frac{1}{1+z} - 1 + 1)\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(\frac{1}{1+z})\]
                \[ -ct = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
                \[ d_t = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                In this hypothesis, \(H_0\) no longer represents the expansion rate of the universe, but still plays a familiar role in relating
                redshift to distance.
            </p>

            <h3>Compared to data</h3>

            <p>
                To test the hypothesis against the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, a distance modulus needs to be calculated from the redshift.
                A distance modulus can be obtained from a luminosity distance, for which we will use \(-ct(1+z)\), which accounts for the effects of time 
                dilation in the flux of the light source.
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/pantheonshoes_dm.png"></p>

            <p>
                To calculate a best fit for the hypothesis to determine a value for Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), we'll use this equation for the sum 
                of squared errors (SSE):
            </p>

            <p>
                \[\chi^2= \Sigma_i (\mu_i^{d} - \mu_i^{m})^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>where \( \mu_i^d \) is the distance modulus of the i-th supernova in the dataset, and \( \mu_i^m \) is the distance modulus 
                predicted by the model from the redshift z.
                The best fit to the data is the model with the lowest SSE.
                When an SSE is calculated for the hypothesis over a range of \(H_0\), the best fit is 70.4 km/s/Mpc. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sse.png"></p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis is also shown here to be a better fit to the data than the concodrance model of cosmology, &Lambda;CDM.
                In fact, these calculations show that the hypothesis is a better fit to the supernovae data than any "flat" FLRW model 
                (\(\Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_M = 1\)), for any value of \(H_0\):
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sselcdm.png"></p>

            <p>
                Although lacking a geometrical foundation, the ad hoc hypothesis is simpler than the standard model of cosmology, and it's a better 
                fit for the supernovae data, which may be of some practical value as-is. However, in the tradition of general relativity,
                a solution that arises from an underlying geometry is preferred. 
            </p>


            <h2>A geometrical solution</h2>

            <p>
                The dimension of time is commonly considered to be the real number line, \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). 
                Let's suppose the dimension of time is instead curved in a circle, perhaps something like
                \(t\in\mathbb{S}^1\), where \( \mathbb{S}^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                As time passes in circular time, events that occur at a regular interval are evenly spaced along the circle's circumference. 
                From a point on the circle, the distance to each event in the 2D space by way of the Pythagorean theorem, however, will not be 
                evenly spaced. On the other side of the circle, the events will be bunched up. Were the time that we observe acting this way, it would be 
                time contracted and light would be blueshifted. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timecircle.png"></p>

            <p>
                Since those effects are the opposite of what we observe, consider time on the surface of a hyperbola rather than a circle.
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timehyperbola.png"></p>

            <p>
                Hyperbolic time, then, would seem to be able to produce time dilation and redshift of the past when observed from the present.
                And it would also seem that a universe with static spatial coordinates, and a time that slowed down at a distance is de Sitter's original 1917
                universe.
