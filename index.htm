<h1>Fixing Hubble's Law</h1>

<h2>The Problem</h2>

<p>Finding the right value for Hubble's Constant has been difficult. </p>

</ul>
<p>To visualize the problem, imagine you shoot a laser beam into space, and it passes a series of targets placed 200 million light years apart.</p>

<p>In a simple universe, the laser beam will reach the first target in 200 million years, the second target in 400 million light years, and so on.</p>

<div id="staticModel"></div>

<p>But we don't live in such a simple universe. We observe cosmological redshifts. These are an observed fact, and you can learn more about 
    <a href="redshift.htm">cosmological redshift here</a>.
    
<p>The redshifts are interpreted as the expansion of space. In this universe, the targets will be moving away from us according to Hubble's Law:</p>

<blockquote>
    <code>v = H &times; D</code>
</blockquote>

<p>where <code>v</code> is the velocity of the target, <code>H</code> is Hubble's Constant, and <code>D</code> is the starting distance of the target</p>

<p>According to observations of relatively near phenomena, <code>H</code> is measured to be 74 km/sec / Mpc.</p>

<div id="expandingFast"></div>

<p>But according to measurements at our most distant observable range, <code>H</code> is measured as 67 km/sec / Mpc.</p>

<div id="expandingSlow"></div>

<p>Yet another <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02087">measurement based on the curvature of space</a> puts <code>H</code> at 54 km/sec / Mpc.</p>

<div id="expanding54"></div>

<p>As the measurements become more accurate, they remain in disagreement.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Hypothesis</h2>

<blockquote> 
    We may state with some confidence that red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle of nature.
    We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, 
    familiar principle by an ad hoc explanation unless we are forced to that step by actual observations.

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 22, 1937
</blockquote>

<p>Edwin Hubble said that it was convenient for the redshift to be interpreted as a Doppler-like effect, leading to the expanding universe theory. 
    He also said redshifts might be interpreted as how nature actually works. 
    In other words, the redshifts aren't caused by some other phenomenon; cosmological redshift is a new phenomenon in-and-of itself. 
    However, he cautioned, if there are existing ways to explain the redshifts, adding a new principle of nature should be avoided.</p>

<p>But choosing the path of the familiar principles over a new principle 
    has forced us to propose several new principles anyways, including dark energy and inflation. 
    It is also unclear, despite many accurate measurements, how fast space is expanding.</p>

<p>Let's back up then and ask: if cosmological redshifts do represent a new principle of nature, what is that principle? Consider the following premises:</p>

<ul>
    <li>A decrease in frequency is observed</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://byjus.com/wave-speed-formula/" target="_out">speed of a wave</a> is <code>v = frequency &times; wavelength</code></li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, if these premises are taken literally and plainly (and somewhat naively):</p>

<ul>
    <li>the observed decrease in frequency should result in a decrease in speed.</li>
</ul>

<p>To examine this literal interpretation of redshifts, I considered possible models where the speed of a photon begins at <code>c</code> and decreases 
    as the distance from its source increases.</p>

<p>The simplest of these models is one where <code>H &times; D</code> is just subtracted from <code>c</code>.</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 1: the speed of light = c - H &times; D</b></p>

<div id="redshift1"></div>

<p>This hypothesis achieves something interesting. Even though the targets are stationary, the time it takes to reach the next target increases 
    in a way that is similar to the time it would take to reach a moving target.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't seem to help with the issue of Hubble's constant. Observations say there is a faster rate of redshift in the nearby universe 
    and a slower rate of redshift in the farthest parts of the observable universe. Compared to the standard expanding model, Hypothesis 1 makes the problem worse.</p>

<button id="show-tension">Click to Toggle Hubble Tension</button>
<script>
    var showTension = false
    document.getElementById("show-tension").onclick = e => showTension = !showTension
</script>

<p>To match observations, more redshift is needed in the first half, and less is needed in the second half. </p>

<p>I thought about dividing <code>H &times; D</code> by an increasing number, 
    but <code>H &times; D</code> itself increases as the photon travels. So how about dividing <code>c</code> by that?</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 2: the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)</b></p>

<div id="redshift2"></div>

<p>This hypothesis results in a much higher rate of redshift for nearby objects and a much lower rate of redshift for far away objects, compared to the expanding models.
</p>

<p>In this hypothesis, the units of <code>H</code> are independent of the units of <code>c</code>. The units of <code>H</code> are inverse length, which means <code>(1 + H &times; D)</code> is unitless. 
    </p>


<p>On the graph, hypothesis 2 makes more of a straight line than a curve.  
    By making it an inverse square law, a more pronounced curve can be made. </p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 3: the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)<sup>2</sup></b></p>

<div id="redshift3"></div>

<p>Squaring just <code>H &times; D</code> makes an even more interesting curve.</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 4: the speed of light = c / (1 + (H &times; D)<sup>2</sup>)</b></p>

<div id="redshift4"></div>

<p>These models and others can be examined on <a href="test.htm">the Testing Page.</a></p>

<p>In these models, the laser beam shows delays in reaching the targets, even though the targets are stationary. In such a universe, 
    space is not expanding. </p>



<p>
    This conclusion raises questions that must be addressed that include:
    <ul>
        <li>Isn't the expansion of the universe a fact?</li>
        <li>Doesn't the Cosmic Microwave Background confirm an expanding universe?</li>
        <li>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light theory?</li>
        <li>Is this a Varying Speed of Light theory?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</li>
        <li>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this predict redshifted stars in our own galaxy?</li>
        <li>... more to come as questions come in</li>

<h2>Isn't the expansion of the universe a fact?</h2>

<p>Not exactly. The <i>redshifts</i> are an observed fact. The redshifts may be interpreted as motion, which leads to the expansion of the universe as a 
    hypothetical consequence. If every galaxy is moving away from our galaxy, that would put our galaxy in some special spot in the universe. 
    But if every galaxy is moving away from every galaxy, we would be in a normal galaxy in an expanding universe. </p>

<p>The theoretical expansion of the universe has hypothetical consequences of its own: a small, young universe dominated by dark energy, dark matter.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble never accepted the expanding theory as a fact. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, 
    but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, 
    that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents <b>the observable region as an 
    insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time</b>. 

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 47, 1937 (emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>Much has changed since his day though. From the 30's through the 60's, the universe was thought to have begun as a point that grew out consistently.</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/expansion_classic.jpg"></p>

<p>But in the 1970's problems began to emerge. To make a software analogy, there were a lot of bugs that needed patching. Such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These problems lead to the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">inflation.</a> 
    The universe blows up super fast in the first nanosecond after the big bang, then chills out. Then in 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe">accelerating.</a></p>

<p>Today, the expanding theory of the universe looks like this:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img width="700px" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg"></p>

<p>If the benefit of interpreting redshifts as motion is that it doesn't require any new physics, 
    then the expanding theory gave that benefit away decades ago. </p>

<p>To make the problem worse, as we peer into the "early universe", we don't see only young galaxies. We see mature systems like the ones around us.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://skyandtelescope.org/astronomy-news/dead-ringer-milky-way-found-early-universe/">"Dead Ringer" for the Milky Way Found in Early Universe</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.space.com/how-can-a-star-be-older-than-the-universe.html"> How Can a Star Be Older Than the Universe?</a></li>

    <li>More <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BigBangSkeptics">here.</a>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons and others, the widely accepted expansion theory is increasingly being compared to outdated software: 
    burdened by outlandish patches and still full of bugs.
    Here's a sample:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1995: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/377099a0">Nature: Big Bang not yet dead but in decline</a></li>
    <li>2004: <a href="http://cosmology.info/media/open-letter-on-cosmology.html">Open Letter on Cosmology / Cosmology Statement</a></li>

    <li>More <a href="http://cosmology.info/resources/index.html">here.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, the <i>redshifts</i> of distant galaxies are observed facts. The motion of those galaxies and the expansion of space are theoretical interpretations of the facts.</p>

<h2>Doesn't the Cosmic Microwave Background confirm an expanding universe?</h2>

<p>The expanding universe theory predicts we observe the same background temperature in all directions.</p>

<p>This prediction seemed to hold until 2003 when anomalies appeared, which were confirmed in 2013:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmb.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
    Two Cosmic Microwave Background anomalous features hinted at by Planck's predecessor, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), 
    are confirmed in the new high precision data from Planck.  One is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the 
    sky (indicated by the curved line), with slightly higher average temperatures in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and slightly lower 
    average temperatures in the northern ecliptic hemisphere. <b>This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe 
    should be broadly similar in any direction we look.</b> There is also a cold spot that extends over a patch of sky that is much larger 
    than expected (circled). In this image the anomalous regions have been enhanced with red and blue shading to make them more clearly visible.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/planck/-/51559-hemispheric-asymmetry-and-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background">
        https://sci.esa.int/web/planck/-/51559-hemispheric-asymmetry-and-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background</a>
</blockquote>

<p>This raises the question of where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot">CMB Cold Spot</a> might appear to other observers.</p>

<p>For instance, imagine observers at the north and south poles of our observable universe:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmbobservers.png"></p>

<p>We see a cold spot to the south. Does the south observer see a cold spot to their south? Does the north observer see the same CMB anomalies as we do?</p>

<p>This is a question the expanding universe theory doesn't have a clear answer for.</p>

<p>However, if the observable region is, as Hubble puts it, "an insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time",
    then there are no anomalies or questions. The cold spot is to <i>our</i> south, but to the southern observer the cold spot is in their vicinity. </p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that before the expanding theory even existed, Arthur Eddington 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Timeline_of_prediction,_discovery_and_interpretation">
        calculated the temperature of starlight in our galaxy to be 3.18 Kelvin</a>. As such, the CMB may just be photons limping in 
        from galaxies 14 billion light years away, right before the temperature of space takes over our measurements. </p>
<hr>

<h2>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light theory?</h2>

<p>There have been 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981A%26AS...45..129R/abstract">hundreds of theories</a> that don't involve expanding space
    trying to explain how light gets "tired" during long intergalactic journeys, 
    starting all the way back to 1929 when the redshift-distance relation was first published.
</p>

<p>Tired light theories fail because they don't
    account for enough redshift, they can't explain the distance factor, or the redshifts are caused in a way that would include other observable results, 
    which ultimately are not observed.</p>

<p>In general, tired light theories have the following in common:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some other phenomenon causes the redshifts</li>
    <li>Light, even though it's "tired", still travels at <code>c</code></li>
    <li>They are represented by the red line on the graph, matching a simple static model</li> 
</ul>

<p>The hypothesis that light's speed is inversely proportional to the distance from its source is different:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nothing causes the redshifts, they are as fundamental to nature as inertia</li>
    <li>Light travels at less than <code>c</code> after millions of years</li>
    <li>The time it takes light to reach a target is similar to the expanding model</li> 
</ul>

<p>It should come as no surprise to us that there are fundamental laws of nature we would only detect once we had telescopes
    that can see what's out beyond the Milky Way.</p>

<p>If dark energy, which hasn't been observed, is in the consideration as a possible fundamental ingredient of nature, 
    then the actual observations that led to its conjecture, cosmological redshift, should be considered a worthy candidate as well.

<hr>

<h2>Is this a Varying Speed of Light theory?</h2>

<p>In the last decade there have been versions of a theory going around known as Varying Speed of Light (VSL):</p>

<blockquote>
    There are others that think such dark energy ideas are now getting too convoluted, and that a much simpler explanation, one that even Einstein considered, should now be given serious consideration; a change in the speed of light, or VSL (Varying Speed of Light) as others know it by.
<br>
<br>
“The ‘tension’ between measurements of the Hubble-Lemaire constant, H0, (which is known to be changing over time) shows that old theories of the Universe are missing something. If H0 was the lower value of 67 km/sec/Mpc, much or all of the so-called acceleration would vanish. The differing values may be explained if the speed of light has changed between the early and late universe,” said Louise Riofrio, an author and scientist who now works at an observatory association in Hawaii. 
<br>
<br>
<a href=https://room.eu.com/news/as-mystery-of-the-universes-expansion-rate-widens-a-simple-solution-is-offered">As mystery of the Universe’s expansion rate widens, a simple solution is offered</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In VSL theories, the speed of light is different now than in the past. This changes the speed of <i>all</i> photons in the universe to the same speed. 
    Space is still expanding, according to VSL theories. The change in the speed of light is not meant to explain cosmological redshift and take the place of the expansion of space, 
    but to explain what appears to be the accelerating rate of the expansion.</p>

<p>The hypothesis in this paper is that the speed of light for an <i>individual</i> photon slows, not that <code>c</code> itself changes for all photons across space.
    The speed of each photon is particular to its own history, not the universe's. The change in the speed of light in this hypothesis <i>is</i> meant to represent 
    cosmological redshift and take the place of expanding space.</p>

<p>In the hypothesis presented in this paper, the speed of light <i>does</i> vary, and light <i>does</i> get tired, 
    but it is mathematically novel to the established Varying Speed of Light and Tired Light theories.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</h2>

<p>Yes. The hypothesis is that the speed of light decreases with distance from the source, which is noticeable after traveling millions of years.</p>

<p>Special relativity tells us that light travels at <code>c</code> over all distances, even after millions and billions of years. </p> 

<p>But our experiments don't last millions of years. In our experiments, H &times; D is so small, it can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So if:</p>

<pre>
    v_light = c / (1 + H &times; D)
    
    and:
    
    H &times; D = 0
    
    then:
    
    v_light = c / (1 + 0)
    
    v_light = c
</pre>

<p>In which case there shouldn't be any conflict with special relativity in the domain where the redshifts don't appear.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</h2>

<p>In the specific model demonstrated here, yes, energy is lost. 
    It could be that the energy deducted from the photon is deposited in space as it travels. </p>

<p>But I will let the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a> do the talking on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
    The thing about photons is that they redshift, losing energy as space expands. 
    If we keep track of a certain fixed number of photons, the number stays constant while the energy per photon decreases, 
    so the total energy decreases. A decrease in energy is just as much a “violation of energy conservation” as an increase in energy, 
    but it doesn’t seem to bother people as much. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how bothersome it is, of course — it’s a 
    crystal-clear prediction of general relativity.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/">https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In an expanding universe, photons redshift and energy is lost.</p>

<p>Under the literal interpretation of redshifts, however, energy could be lost, or it could be deposited throughout space. 
    The photon could simply decay into tiny particles left in its path after 14 billion years.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</h2>

<p>This is the first obvious test of the hypothesis.</p>

<p>The task is to come up with a clever way to measure the speed of ancient light without disturbing the photon.</p>

<p>Say that light travels for hundreds of millions of years, and slows to below c, and then hits your telescope's lens.</p>

<p>At the quantum level, the photon will have been <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod5.html">absorbed by atoms</a> in the lens. 
    Then a new photon, or maybe the old one, is emitted and focused to your telescope's eyepiece.</p>

<p>The photon may have traveled great distances from its source before it encountered your telescope, 
    but the light inside the telescope will be very close to its source: the lens that focused it. 
    The D of the photons in the telescope will not be millions of light years, but rather a few dozen centimeters.</p>

<p>Thus, any light that we interact with will presumably be moving at c / (1 + H &times; 0), or just c.</p>

<p>If there was a way to measure the speed of ancient light without interacting with it, that would make a good test of the hypothesis. </p>

<hr>

<h2>Doesn't this predict redshifted stars in our own galaxy?</h2>

<p>That depends on the hypothesis used.</p>

<p>To see the differences between them, a better view of the graph is needed. 
    Let's put the ratio between time in the hypothesis and time in a static universe on the 
    y-axis.</p>


<button id="set-y-axis">Set y-axis to ratio to static</button>

<p>From this view, the expanding models (white) are a straight line. Hypothesis 1 (green) lags behind the expanding models,
    while hypotheses 2 and 3 (magenta and purple) jump out a ways ahead initially before tapering off.</p>
    
<p>Hypothesis 4 (red) does something different. It lags behind for hundreds of millions of years, then jumps out ahead, and then flattens out.</p>

<p>So what do the models predict for redshifts in our own galaxy?</p>

<ul>
    <li>Hypothesis 1: Yes</li>
    <li>Hypotehsis 2: Big Yes</li>
    <li>Hypothesis 3: Big Yes</li>
    <li>Hypothesis 4: No (almost none)</li>
</ul>

<p>Hypothesis 4 shows a staggering difference from what's predicted by any of the other models, including the expanding ones. 
    There is almost no expansion for hundreds of millions of years, which fits with observations very closely.</p> 

<p>Shown by itself and the main measurements behind the disagreement in values for Hubble's constant, we get the following picture:</p>

<p class="pimg">
    <img src="img/hubble_relief_labels.png">
</p>

<p>The space between the white lines represents the Hubble tension, and the red line is the suggested solution.</p> 

<p></p>

<hr>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Cosmological redshifts have been a known, observed fact since 1929.</p>

<p>We could assume the redshifts indicate motion, which means the universe is expanding, which means there are age and size limits to the universe, 
    which means it inflated in the first nanosecond, which means it is dominated by dark matter and dark energy, and it's currently accelerating.
</p>

<p>Or we could assume the redshifts are a new feature of the universe that can only be noticed at great distances by large telescopes, and that's it. </p>

<p>With several hypotheses in hand, how to test them becomes the next question.</p>

<p>If the universe were expanding, in millions of years distant galaxies will be more distant than they are now, and the CMB will have a lower temperature.</p>

<p>In an indefinite universe, those distant galaxies will still be redshifted millions of years from now, but they will be in about the same place. 
    And the CMB will be the same temperature. </p>

<p>If we had millions of years to wait around, that would be a nice test to do.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I'm sure we'll think of others.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I would like to quote Hubble one last time. Here is his conclusion to <u>The Observational Approach to Cosmology</u>, pg. 52, 1937:</p>

<blockquote>We seem to face, as once before in the days of Copernicus, a choice between a small, finite universe, 
    and a universe indefinitely large plus a new principle of nature. </blockquote>
