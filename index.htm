        <h2>The Redshift-Distance Relation</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>

        <p>
            The discovery of a relationship between a galaxy's distance and its <a href="redshift.htm">redshift</a> established that the universe is expanding.
            And as the distances to farther objects were measured, their redshifts were less than expected, 
            which means in the past, the universe wasn't expanding as fast as it is now.
        </p>

        <p>Currently, there is no single equation to relate distance and redshift that fits the entire range of data.
            The following equation is proposed as a new redshift-distance relation, which works for measured values and makes predictions 
            to be compared against future measurements.
        </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/redshift-distance-relation.png"></p>

        <p>
            From this equation, redshift (<i>z</i>) can be found from distance (<i>D</i>) and vice versa, using a constant (<i>L</i>), 
            which is a length of about 26 billion light years.
        </p>

        <h3>Methodology</h3>

        <p>
            To help reason about the expansion of space, consider a runner on a track. If the runner maintains a constant speed,
            the length of each step taken by the runner, and the time between each step, should remain constant throughout the race. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now consider a race between three such runners beginning at the same speed, each facing a disadvantage.</p>
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Runner 1: Dynamic Track, everything moves away at <i>H<sub>0</sub>D</i></li>
            <li>Runner 2: Dynamic Clock, clock speed is <i>c/(c-H<sub>0</sub>D)</i></li>
            <li>Runner 3: Dynamic Runner, runs at <i>c-H<sub>0</sub>D</i></li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        </p>
            The three runners should always tie, assuming <i>H<sub>0</sub>D</i> is equal for all, which you will recognize from Hubble's law, <i>v=H<sub>0</sub>D</i>.
        </p>

        </p>

        <div id="runner2">
            Runner 1: <span class="red">Dynamic Track</span>
            <br>
        </div>

        <div id="runner3">
            Runner 2: <span class="red">Dynamic Clock</span>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/mikehelland/hubbles-law/blob/master/presentations/runners/embed.js">Source Code</a></p>

        <p>
            Runner 1 on the expanding track will find that the distance between their steps increases. Runners 2 and 3 will find that the time in between their steps increases.
            Using that data, a <i>z</i> can be calculated for each runner:
        </p>

        <table style="margin:auto; text-align: center; font-style: italic;" >
            <tr>
                <td>Redshift based on step length</td>
                <td>Redshift based on step frequency</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/zformula2.png">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/zformula.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            When the calculated redshifts are compared to the co-moving distance (the distance where the point on the track with that redshift was at the beginning of the race)
            then we can see that each runner produces the same redshifts. We can then compare those redshifts and distances (green line) to actual data from the universe (yellow dots).
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/supernovae-basic.png"></p>

        <p>
            The runners' redshifts increase too quickly with distance to match the observational data.
            Runner 3, for example, loses the appropriate amount of 
            speed to match the data early on in the race, but loses too much speed as the race goes on. 
            The clock rate of Runner 2 is also increasing too rapidly. To address this, new versions of these runners are made like so:
        </p>

        
        <table style="margin:auto; text-align: center; font-style: italic;" >
            <tr>
                <td>Runner 2.1's clock rate</td>
                <td>Runner 3.1's speed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/runner2.1.png">
                </td>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/runner3.1.png">
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        

        <p>The new versions of our runners, Runner 2.1 and Runner 3.1, still finish in a tie.</p> 
        
        <p>
            <button id="start-race-2-button">Go!</button>
        </p>
    
        <div id="runner11" style="display: none;">
            Runner 1.1: <span class="red">Dynamic Track</span>
            <br>

        <div id="runner21">
            Runner 2.1: <span class="red">Dynamic Clock</span>

        <div id="runner31">
            Runner 3.1: <span class="red">Dynamic Runner</span>
            <br>
        </div>

        <p>The redshifts produced by these runners (shown below in purple) don't diverge from the data like the previous group (shown in green).
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/supernovae-2.png"></p>

        <p>
            The term <i>H<sub>0</sub>/c</i> has units of Mpc<sup>-1</sup>.  If we invert it to <i>c/H<sub>0</sub></i>, 
            the result is a length, which we can call <i>L</i>, so <i>L = c/H<sub>0</sub></i>.
        </p>

        <p>
            This allows us to simplify our equations. 
        </p>

        <table style="margin:auto; text-align: center; font-style: italic;" >
            <tr>
                <td>Runner 2.1's clock rate</td>
                <td>Runner 3.1's speed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>
            The redshifts produced by these runners is a better fit for the data, but it's still not quite right.
            Out of curiosity, I decided to square the <i>1+D/L</i> terms, and produced two new runners.
        </p>

        <table style="margin:auto; text-align: center; font-style: italic;" >
            <tr>
                <td>Runner 2.2's clock rate</td>
                <td>Runner 3.2's speed</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <img src="img/runner2.2.png">

                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Treating <i>L</i> as a free parameter, through trial and error I found (a bit surprisingly) that <i>L=2c/H<sub>0</sub></i>,
            is a good fit for the data, shown below by the white line. 
            Also shown for comparison are data points for the LambdaCDM model, 
            from <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=galaxy+with+redshift+z%3D+1+hubble+parameter+%3D+74">Wolfram Alpha</a>.
        </p>


        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/supernovae-all.png"></p>

        <p>
        In the redshifts produced by Runner 3, when <i>z=1, 2, 3,</i> and so on, the runner's velocity is <i>v=0.5c, 0.333c, 0.25c</i>, and so on, such that:

        <p>
        Therefore:

        </blockquote>

        <p>
            Despite being derived from a non-expanding model, this equation predicts the observed 
            <i>z</i> and <i>D</i> of a galaxy in an expanding universe that is accelerating. It is consistent with LambdaCDM where we have observational data, and 
            predicts different redshifts where we don't yet have data, which can be compared with future observations.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        
        <p>
            Runner 3 is meant to be a helpful tool in thinking about what's going in a dynamic space (or time) without actually having a dynamic space (or time).
            A decreasing speed isn't viable as a physical theory because a photon, which the runner represents, cannot slow down. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Runner 2, though, doesn't slow down, avoiding many conflicts with the laws of physics. However, because the redshifts of Runner 2 are caused by a dynamic of time, 
            rather than of space, the size of the universe doesn't change over time, which is in conflict with the big bang theory. 
        </p> 

        <p>
            For most cosmologists, the debate on interpreting the redshifts as the expansion of the universe is long settled. It can almost be directly observed that time began around 14 billion years ago.
            When we look into space and thus back in time, we can see that the most distant galaxies are small and disordered, unlike the galaxies nearby.   
        </p>

        <p>
            In the last ten years however, we have observed massive, dusty galaxies with ordered features and shut down star formation
            at all distances, well before they are predicted to have appeared<sup>[1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9]</sup>.

            Is the expansion of the universe a fact? This was debated in the 1930's and very violently interrupted by World War II. This is an unconventional argument to make,
            but science does not operate in a vacuum. And while the war made science a priority, and produced many giant leaps forward, the science of galactic 
            nebulae was not one of those priorities.
        </p>

        <p>
            To illustrate how drastic an interruption this was, in December of 1941, Edwin Hubble, the man credited for discovering the expanding universe, 
            <a href="img/paper1941.png">announced
            that he had refuted the expanding universe theory</a>. Soon, he would no longer be looking through telescopes, but instead 
            <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hubble-edwin-1889-1953">working in a windtunnel on 
            ballistics research</a> for the war effort.
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 1950's, a new generation came back to the telescopes, armed with two expanding universe theories: the big bang theory, where the universe was smaller in the past,
            and the steady-state theory, where expansion of space produces matter, keeping the density of the universe the same. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In the 1960's the discovery of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) led to the acceptance of the big bang theory over the steady state theory.
            It looked like this:
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="400" src="img/expansion_classic.jpg"><br>Big Bang 1.0</p>

        <p>By the 1970's, it was apparent this theory had some problems 
            (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a>,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a>, 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a>)
            which were solved by a period of super-expansion right after the big bang.
            This period is called cosmic inflation, and it looks like this:
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="400" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg"><br>Big Bang 2.0</p>

        <p>By the 1990's, as mentioned before, the measurements of distances and redshifts showed that the expansion of the universe must be accelerating:
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="400" src="img/acceleration.jpg"><br>Big Bang 3.0</p>


        <p>
            Today, Big Bang 3.0, also known as LambdaCDM, is famously 
            <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/best-yet-measurements-deepen-cosmological-crisis/">in conflict with independent measurements</a><sup>[10][11][12][13][14]</sup>.
            A Big Bang 4.0 might be on the way.
        </p>

        <p>
            Over the decades, some have criticized the big bang theory for the continual need for major, ad hoc changes to fit observations.

            But viable alternatives to the expanding universe theory face considerable obstacles, such as explaining the CMB.
            If the energy of the CMB is not from the beginning of the universe, what is it from? Is it even related to the redshifts? 
            Without a valid explanation for the CMB, a theory of redshifts, no matter how good it is, is not good enough
            to topple the expanding universe theory.
        </p>
            


        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        
        <p>Some readers may not find discussing alternative redshift interpretations to be an effective use of their time. For the reader who wishes to use 
            their time most effectively, having a simple, empirically faithful redshift-distance relation may be useful.

            <summary>The CMB indicates a hot past</summary>

            <p>The Cosmic Microwave Background was predicted by the big bang theory
                as a remnant of the fiery conditions at the beginning of the universe, and its discovery is an important piece of evidence for the theory. </p>
        
            <p>If the decelerating photon hypothesis is correct, the CMB must have some other explanation. Consider the following facts:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li>Photons lose energy with distance</li>
                <li>There is energy coming from all directions as microwave background radiation</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>The energy lost through redshifting and the energy of the CMB might be more closely related than we currently think.
                What happens to the energy a photon loses when it redshifts? It has to go somewhere.
                If the energy lost by redshifting is discarded into space it would start to pile up.</p>
        
            <p>If space is filling up with the energy discarded by redshifting photons,
                when the energy in a volume of space is greater than the energy equivalent of 
                the temperature of its surroundings, that volume of space should start emitting radiation to cool to equilibrium.
            </p>
        
            <p>This might take the form of a "background" field that receives the energy lost by redshifting photons 
                and returns the energy to the EM field as photons to reach a thermal equilibrium.</p>
            
            <p>Early 20th century astronomers calculated that the minimum temperature to which a black body in our galaxy
                would cool is about 3 K 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Timeline_of_prediction,_discovery_and_interpretation">
                    well before the CMB was discovered</a>.</p>
        
            
            <p>The CMB was discovered in 1964 at 3 K, which has been refined to around 2.7 K.
        
            <p>In the expanding model, the similarity between the predicted effective temperature of our galaxy and the temperature
                of the CMB is a coincidence.</p> 
        
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, the temperature of the CMB is an effect of the 
                background field cooling to the effective temperature of the galaxy.

            <summary>The Tolman surface brightness test indicates an expanding universe</summary>


            <p>The Tolman Surface Brightness Test is meant to distinguish a static universe from an expanding one.</p>

            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, a photon experiences the same delays in the journey as a photon would in expanding space. 
                But successive photons in an expanding universe would experience higher delays, whereas each successive photon in the decelerating photon hypothesis
                experiences the same delay as the first photon.</p>

            <p>An expanding universe predicts an extra factor of dimming, due to the photons arriving at a lower rate due to the galaxy's motion away from us.
                Based on observations, it predicts one factor too many<sup>[25]</sup>:
            </p>
                    
            <blockquote>"The exponent found is not 4 as expected in the simplest expanding model, but 2.6 or 3.4, depending on the frequency band."

            <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis predicts one fewer factor than the expanding universe, matching observations.</p>

            <p>Also note that the frequency of the light made a difference here. In an expanding universe, that would be impossible.</p>

            <summary>Time dilation in supernovae light curves indicate an expanding universe</summary>

            <p>Due to the expanding universe, a nearby event that lasts for 20 days, such as a supernova, would appear to last longer when the event takes place far away.
                That is because of the same reason that an expanding universe predicts a fourth dimming factor in the surface brightness test: the galaxy is 
                farther away each time it emits light.
                This is known as time dilation, and it is observed in the light curves of distant supernovae. 
                The more dilated the duration of the event, the farther away it must be.
            </p>
        
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, space is not expanding, and thus it cannot stretch the time it takes for an event to occur. The only way
                the decelerating photon hypothesis could be true then, is if the longer supernovae observed are not time dilated, but actually much bigger supernovae than we
                assume they are.</p>
        
            <p>This is the position argued by Jensen<sup>[26]</sup>, page 5:</p>
        
            <blockquote>On the other hand, the Delta(15) values seem to indicate the opposite trend, the
                light curves and therefore the supernovae themselves are actually getting smaller with increasing
                redshift! Why would this be true? Why would we find smaller supernova with increasing
                redshift? Unless the morphology of supernova are changing, and the spectra indicate that they are
                not, we should expect the size of the supernova we actually observe to increase slightly with
                distance, a predictable Malmquist type II bias of about 4%.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>And page 6:</p>
        
            <blockquote>
                This same argument can be made with the most basic piece of statistical data: Supernovae rise
                    times: In the local universe, the average rise time is 20 days, but in the redshifted universe; it is
                    17.5 days, which again, would tend to indicate more distant supernova are smaller (Li). If this
                    time dilation factor is removed, the high redshift sample has an average rise time of about 25
                    days. This is too long for normal Ia, but not if the distance modulus and
                    the corresponding attenuation factor are underestimated. In this case, the higher redshifted SNe Ia
                    would indeed be over-represented by very high magnitude ‘peculiar’ Ia, or hypernova. Credence
                    is given to this conjecture by the fact the number of supernova actually found in high redshift
                    surveys represent only a small fraction (~4%) of the expected yield (Tonry).
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>Jensen argues that the farther we look into space and the larger our sample size becomes, the smaller the average supernova appears to be, contrary 
                to expectations. 
                He advocates adjusting for a Malmquist type II bias, meaning the farther into space we look,
                the lower the fraction of the galaxy's light will reach us, altering our measurements. 
                These particularly long lasting supernovae are then 
                not only larger events than we think they are, they are also farther away than we think.</p>
