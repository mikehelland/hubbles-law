        <h1>Hubble's Law as an Inverse Square Law</h1>
        <h2>A Testable Cosmology with Practical Applications</h2>
        
        <p>A change to Hubble's law provides a new cosmology that fits the observed acceleration
            of redshifts using distance, the speed of light, and a static 
            Hubble constant with zero other parameters. The CMB is proposed to be not of cosmological origin,
            but a consequence of the conservation of energy and thermodynamics applied to the redshifted energy of photons. 
            Testing the hypothesis is presently feasible and would yield working practical technology 
            if confirmed.</p>

            <hr>

        <h3>Background</h3>

        <p>
        Many years ago I found a trick that could in a sense mimic the expansion of space in a physics model. It's based on the fact that as space expands, the travel time to a distant galaxy increases. One consequence of the expansion of space is, loosely speaking, that time expands too: increasing distances means increasing durations. 
        </p>

        <p>
        To demonstrate this, here's a model of targets placed in space 100 million light years apart. A photon is emitted, and in the static universe (blue) the photon reaches a new target every 100 million years, while in an expanding universe (white), the photon is lagging behind. 
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/vcHD.gif"></p>


        <p>
        The trick is, rather than place everything in the physics model in motion away from everything else, these time delays could be exactly reproduced by just slowing down the photon (green).
        </p>

        <p>
        In a simple expanding universe, everything moves away from the observer at v=HD. In this mock-expansion model, the photon's velocity is v=c-HD. This just moves HD from one velocity to another. These models also produce the exact same redshifts as each other, for the same value of H.
        </p>

        <p>
        The code for calculating the time delays and redshifts is here: <a href="modeling_expansion.htm">Modeling Expansion</a>.
        </p>

        <h3>The Expansion Rate of the Universe</h3>
        <p>
        Recently, the question of exactly how fast space is expanding has received a lot of attention. The current expansion rate seems to be faster than it was in the past.
        </p>

        <p>
        With that in mind, I considered the mock-expansion idea and different ways to change it. A photon in the mock expansion model begins with a velocity of c that decreases by HD as it travels. Something similar happens if, rather than subtract HD from c, you divide c by 1 + HD. At first, when D=0, v=c/(1+0), which is v=c. As HD gets bigger, v gets smaller.
        </p>

        <p>
        Hubble's constant usually has units of km/s/Mpc, which works out to units of inverse time. Those units no longer work for v=c/(1+HD). This requires new units that are of inverse distance. 
        Using the form v=c/(1+D/H) inverts the inverse distance to just plain distance, and ends up being much more intuitive.
        </p>

        <p>
        By putting variations on a theme, I devised similar but different mathematical models to compare:
        </p>

        <ul>
        <li> hypothesis 1: v = c - HD</li>
        <li> hypothesis 2: v = c / (1 + D/H)</li>
        <li> hypothesis 3: v = c / (1 + D/H)<sup>2</sup></li>
        <li> hypothesis 4: v = c / (1 + (D/H)<sup>2</sup>)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
        When graphed, the time delays and redshifts in all four are, of course, different from each other. 
        </p>

        <p class="pimg">
            <img width="540" src="img/timedelays4.png">
            <br>
            Hypothesis 1, H=74 km/s/Mpc (green), Hypothesis 2, H=12.5 Gly (magenta),<br>
            Hypothesis 3, H=25 Gly (red), Hypothesis 4, H=3.8 Gly (orange)
        </p>


        <p>
        The next step was to compare these hypotheses against the observational data. For that I used the <a href="http://supernova.lbl.gov/Union/figures/SCPUnion2.1_mu_vs_z.txt">Supernovae Cosmology Project's data</a>. I converted the distance modulus to co-moving distance, and ran models for the hypotheses and showed the results against the observational data. The code for this is at the bottom of this document. The inverse square variation, hypothesis 3, is a very good fit of the data, for H=25 Gly. 
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="540" src="img/supernovae4.png">
            <br>
            Hypothesis 1, H=74 km/s/Mpc (green), Hypothesis 2, H=12.5 Gly (magenta),<br>
            Hypothesis 3, H=25 Gly (red), Hypothesis 4, H=3.8 Gly (orange)

        </p>
        <p>
        This mock-expansion idea, though, violates a fair amount of the established laws of physics. The question then became, how could this inverse square version of mock-expansion be converted into an actual expansion model? The answer to this question is that objects in the universe are moving away at velocity v = c - c / (1 + D/H)<sup>2</sup>. Such a universe, however, cannot exist. If the expansion of space is not linear, then different observers will determine the same part of space to be expanding at different rates.
        </p>

        <p>
        Although the inverse square variation looked promising for a moment, it appears to be a dead end. That is, unless hypothesis 3 is taken seriously 
        and the conflicts with established physics can be resolved.
        </p>

        <h3>Photon Velocity</h3>

        <p>The redshifts in this hypothesis are not caused by the expansion of space, or other interactions as in tired light theories (discussed in a later section).
            The redshifts are interpreted as their own phenomenon that is as fundamental to nature as inertia. 
            Light from distant galaxies is observed to be redshifted because light redshifts with distance. 
        </p>

        <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis is that cosmological redshifts indicate new physics for a photon:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>A photon loses frequency as it travels cosmological distances, but with no change to wavelength, resulting in a loss of speed, according to v=c/(1+D/H)<sup>2</sup></li>
            <li>The energy of a photon absorbed by matter is emitted as a new photon with D=0, and therefore v=c and an elongated wavelength.</li>
        </ol>

        <!--<p>Taken on their own, each phenomenon would constitute a violation of the conservation of momentum. First losing momentum when the photon redshifts.
            Second, gaining momentum when the photon is absorbed and re-emitted. Together, however, the momentum lost during redshifting is recovered when 
            the photon is absorbed and re-emitted to begin a new journey. 
        </p>
        -->
        
        <p>In this interpretation of the redshifts, the frequency decreases while the photon is in flight, and the wavelength increases at the beginning of a new photon's 
            journey. This is different from the expanding theory where frequency and wavelength change together without affecting the photon's velocity.</p>


        <p>This poses a number of conflicts with existing physics. These are discussed in a later section.</p>

        <p>It is important to keep in mind that interacting with a cosmologically redshifted photon will, according to the hypothesis, reset it's D to zero, causing it to 
            behave as a normal photon. With that in mind, several good tests for this hypothesis can be made where the redshifted light is 
            not disturbed until the end of the experiment.
        </p>

        <h3>Tests and Applications</h3>

        <p>
            If ancient photons have indeed decelerated, a simple test could be devised using existing technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Launch a probe that scans for supernovae, and send it out past Mars. When it detects a supernova in the opposite direction of Earth, 
            send a signal back to us with its location.
        </p>

        <p>If all the photons involved are moving at c, the signal from the probe should reach Earth at the same time as the supernova.
        </p>

        <p>If the decelerating photon hypothesis is correct, the signal from the probe to Earth should travel at c and reach
            us sooner than the slow light from the distant supernova.
        </p>

        <p>If confirmed, such a test would provide a working technology for astronomers to apply immediately to get advanced warnings
            on Earth about events such as supernovae.
        </p>

        <p>Furthermore, using the distant probe we can calculate the speed of the supernova's light, being able to produce a distance measurement 
            free from the influence of peculiar velocity.

                <p><b>Prediction:</b> Observing a high z galaxy on Earth's horizon, when Earth is on opposite sides of the sun,
                should produce more redshift when the Earth is moving away from the distant galaxy than when the Earth is moving toward the galaxy, to a degree
                more exaggerated than for nearby galaxies.

        <h3>Problems and Responses</h3>

        <p>The hypothesis in relation to standard cosmology:</p>

        <details>
            <summary>This is the Tired Light Theory, which is discredited</summary>


            <p>The expanding model has been challenged by hundreds of non-expanding theories, and all of them have failed.
                These theories propose different ways light can interact with matter or other forces to reduce the light's energy, and they are known
                as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light">tired light</a> theories.
            </p>
            
            <p>Light loses energy in the tired light theories, but it never loses speed as the theories are consistent with special relativity. 
                Because tired light moves at c, there are no time delays in a photon's journey
                like there are in the expanding model or the decelerating photon hypothesis. 
                Tired light photons match the arrival time of the simple static model (blue in the gif), while 
                the decelerating photon hypothesis (green) has time delays that match the expanding model (white).
            </p>
    
            <p>In this hypothesis, one could say light <i>does</i> get "tired",  
                but it does so in a way that is conceptually and mathematically unique to the established 
                tired light theories.</p>

            <p>If the decelerating photon hypothesis is correct, the CMB must have some other explanation. Consider the following facts:</p>

                <li>Photons lose energy with distance</li>
                <li>There is energy coming from all directions as microwave background radiation</li>
            </ol>
        
            <p>The energy lost through redshifting and the energy of the CMB might be more closely related than we currently think.
                What happens to the energy a photon loses when it redshifts? It has to go somewhere.
                If the energy lost by redshifting is discarded into space it would start to pile up.</p>
        
            <p>If space is filling up with the energy discarded by redshifting photons,
                when the energy in a volume of space is greater than the energy equivalent of 
                the temperature of its surroundings, that volume of space should start emitting radiation to cool to equilibrium.
            </p>
        
            <p>This might take the form of a "background" field that receives the energy lost by redshifting photons 
                and returns the energy to the EM field as photons to reach a thermal equilibrium.</p>
            
            <p>Early 20th century astronomers calculated that the minimum temperature to which a black body in our galaxy

                        Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainter
                        star-forming population at z > 7, in spite of the very short time
                        since they first appeared.

            <p>The Tolman Surface Brightness Test is meant to distinguish a static universe from an expanding one.</p>

            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, a photon experiences the same delays in the journey as a photon would in expanding space. 
                But successive photons in an expanding universe would experience higher delays, whereas each successive photon in the decelerating photon hypothesis
                experiences the same delay as the first photon.</p>

            <p>An expanding universe predicts an extra factor of dimming, due to the photons arriving at a lower rate due to the galaxy's motion away from us.
                Based on observations, it predicts one factor too many<sup>[25]</sup>:
            </p>

            <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis predicts one fewer factor than the expanding universe, matching observations.</p>

            <summary>Time dilation in supernovae light curves indicate an expanding universe</summary>

            <p>Due to the expanding universe, a nearby event that lasts for 20 days, such as a supernova, would appear to last longer when the event takes place far away.
                That is because of the same reason that an expanding universe predicts a fourth dimming factor in the surface brightness test: the galaxy is 
                farther away each time it emits light.
                This is known as time dilation, and it is observed in the light curves of distant supernovae. 
                The more dilated the duration of the event, the farther away it must be.
            </p>
        
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, space is not expanding, and thus it cannot stretch the time it takes for an event to occur. The only way
                the decelerating photon hypothesis could be true then, is if the longer supernovae observed are not time dilated, but actually much bigger supernovae than we
                assume they are.</p>
        
            <p>This is the position argued by Jensen<sup>[26]</sup>, page 5:</p>
        
            <blockquote>On the other hand, the Delta(15) values seem to indicate the opposite trend, the
                light curves and therefore the supernovae themselves are actually getting smaller with increasing
                redshift! Why would this be true? Why would we find smaller supernova with increasing
                redshift? Unless the morphology of supernova are changing, and the spectra indicate that they are
                not, we should expect the size of the supernova we actually observe to increase slightly with
                distance, a predictable Malmquist type II bias of about 4%.
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>And page 6:</p>
        
            <blockquote>
                This same argument can be made with the most basic piece of statistical data: Supernovae rise
                    times: In the local universe, the average rise time is 20 days, but in the redshifted universe; it is
                    17.5 days, which again, would tend to indicate more distant supernova are smaller (Li). If this
                    time dilation factor is removed, the high redshift sample has an average rise time of about 25
                    days. This is too long for normal Ia, but not if the distance modulus and
                    the corresponding attenuation factor are underestimated. In this case, the higher redshifted SNe Ia
                    would indeed be over-represented by very high magnitude ‘peculiar’ Ia, or hypernova. Credence
                    is given to this conjecture by the fact the number of supernova actually found in high redshift
                    surveys represent only a small fraction (~4%) of the expected yield (Tonry).
            </blockquote>
        
            <p>Jensen argues that the farther we look into space and the larger our sample size becomes, the smaller the average supernova appears to be, contrary 
                to expectations. 
                He advocates adjusting for a Malmquist type II bias, meaning the farther into space we look,
                the lower the fraction of the galaxy's light will reach us, altering our measurements. 
                These particularly long lasting supernovae are then 
                not only larger events than we think they are, they are also farther away than we think.</p>

        <p>The hypothesis in relation to fundamental physics:
        </p>

        <details>
            <summary>Snell's law, Fermat's least time principle</summary>
            <p>
                The hypothesis says that the photon travels at less than c, and then after interacting with matter,
                new photons that travel at c are emitted. If decelerated photons reach a mirror and change speed, 
                the photon's motion can be compared to that of light changing mediums.
            </p>

            <p>This would result in a change to the angle at which decelerated light reflected off a mirror, which would 
                be relevant in the case of the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observing highly redshifted galaxies. 
            </p>

            <p>One would expect then, that if redshifted photons are traveling at less than c, the HST would not be able to resolve 
                them at the expected angles with any clarity. Since the HST does resolve such galaxies, light must be reflecting normally,
                which means the photons have to be moving at c.
            </p>

            <p>This criticism is not resolved. The solution requires the development of a model of light and matter 
                that produces Snell's law and Fermat's least time principle in the expected cases where light changes mediums, 
                yet behaves differently when the photon is traveling at less than c in a vacuum.
            </p>
            
            <p>The current plan is to model the mediums as individual atoms, and show that the matter of the mediums
                is necessary in such a mathematical model to produce Snell's law, and that removing the matter results in 
                the behavior required by the hypothesis.

            <summary>Special Relativity</summary>

            <p>The second postulate of special relativity is that the speed of light in a vacuum is always c, to infinity.</p>
            
            <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis directly contradicts that by saying the velocity of a photon is determined by its distance, v=c-HD in model 2,
                and v=c/(1+D/H)<sup>2</sup> in model 4. However, in the domain where cosmological redshifts aren't observed, 
                HD=0, so v=c in both models at non-cosmological distances.
            </p>

            <p>If the speed of a photon is constant to all observable distances, the proposed tests of the hypothesis would establish that.</p>

            <summary>General Relativity</summary>
            <p>Recall the graph of the time delays from the introduction. If that graph were to include a second photon headed in the opposite direction,
                it would produce a reflected image, like this:</p>
            
            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/lightcones.png" width="500">
                <br>Lightcones in a simple universe (blue), models 1 & 2 (green), model 4 (red)
            </p>
            
            <p>The straight blue lines make the traditional light cone of special relativity.
                The green lines represent both a simple expanding universe (v=H<sub>0</sub>D) and the linear decelerating photon hypothesis (v=c-HD). 
                The red lines are the inverse square decelerating photon hypothesis, model 4 (v=c/(1+HD)<sup>2</sup>).</p> 
            
            <p>To accommodate the observed redshifts, the light cone in relativity must be curved in a way similar to  
                the decelerating photon hypothesis.
            </p>
            
            <p>But there is a very big difference between the two. In general relativity, space expands the null geodesic for all photons. 
                All photons stick to the same geodesic at the same speed.

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/lightcone_gr.png" width="400"></p>
            
            <p>In the decelerating photon hypothesis, each photon begins on the null geodesic, but then diverges according to v=c-HD along its own individual path. 
                The length of each path has a maximum range of c/H, Hubble's length.
                Put another way, Hubble's law would be removed as the scale factor and reapplied in the geodesic equation.
                The <a href="https://youtu.be/-UPSiKugRW0?t=881">velocity vector for a photon</a> 
                should have a distance of HD instead of 0, 
                where D is the sum of the absolute value of its changes in the space direction.
            </p>
            
            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/geodesics.png"></p>
            
            <p>These extra individual paths that diverge from the common path can be seen as time dilations localized to an individual photon.</p> 
            
            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/lightcone_q.png" width="400"></p>
            
            <p>This actually allows for different Hubble volumes to communicate between relays. 
                Information can be sent from one galaxy to a distant one within range. That signal can be received and retransmitted with
                fresh photons, eventually leaving the original broadcaster's Hubble volume.
            </p>
            
            <p>Given an indefinitely old universe, the ability to communicate between Hubble volumes avoids any issues posed by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">the horizon problem</a>, which says different parts of the sky

            <summary>Quantum Mechanics</summary>
            <p>There is nothing in quantum mechanics that resembles anything discussed in this paper. 
                No known interaction will cause the photon to redshift in the manner needed by the decelerating photon hypothesis.
                So the following Feynman diagram is proposed:</p>

            <p>As mentioned in the section on the CMB, this action could be thought of as transferring energy from the photon to the "background" field.</p>
            
        </details>

        <!--
        <h3>Advantages</h3>

        <p>In addition to a simple alternative to dark energy, the hypothesis offers several other advantages. 
            Observations have shown that redshifts might be quantized.
            And the expansion of the universe may differ for light of different wavelengths. If redshifts are caused by space expanding, 
            these would be downright impossible. 
        </p>

        
        
        <p>
            A decelerating photon, if it redshifts in a quantum event, would cause quantized redshifts. And if that might differ slightly 
            for different wavelengths, those features could easily be accommodated too.

        <h3>A New Redshift-Distance Relation</h3>

        <p>Whether or not the interpretation of redshifts proposed here is considered possible or necessary, becaue it fits the acceleration 
            of the redshifts, it can be used as an accurate predictor of z and distance given one or the other. The hypothesis is:
        </p> 

        <blockquote>
            v = c / (1 + HD)<sup>2</sup>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        When used to calculate redshifts, the standard pattern arises that at z=1, v=0.5c, and at z=2, v=0.333c, and so on, such that:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            v = c / (1 + z)
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Therefore:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            c / (1 + z) = c / (1 + HD)<sup>2</sup>
            <br><br>
            1 + z = (1 + HD)<sup>2</sup>
            <br><br>
            sqrt(1 + z) = 1 + HD
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        Solving for D we get:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            D = (sqrt(1 + Z) - 1) / H
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        And solving for z we get:
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            1 + z = 1 + 2HD + HD<sup>2</sup>
            <br><br>
            z = HD<sup>2</sup> + 2HD
        </blockquote>

        <p>
        These formulas predict the observed z and D of a galaxy in an expanding universe that is accelerating, without a cosmological constant or dark energy.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>


    <p>The decelerating photon hypothesis changes the physics of light at cosmological distances to accommodate the redshifts.
        On the other hand, the expanding interpretation of redshifts has led to a change in just about everything in the universe except for light.
    </p>
        
    <p>When interpreting the redshifts as Doppler effects in the early 20th century, astronomers did so because it  
        was known and familiar and didn't require new laws of physics.</p>
    
    <blockquote>
        We may state with some confidence that red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle  of nature. 
        We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, familiar principle by an 
        ad hoc explanation unless we are forced to that step by  actual observations. 
        - 
        <span style="font-style: normal !important">Edwin Hubble</span>

    </blockquote>

    <p>The observed acceleration of the redshifts has forced us to that step.</p>

    <p>
        If dark energy is in the consideration as a possible fundamental ingredient of nature, 
        then the observed phenomenon of cosmological redshift, the actual observations that lead to dark energy, should be considered as well.</p>
