        <h2>Observation</h2>

            <p>
                Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), is the expansion rate of the universe. The most direct pieces of evidence for the expansion of space are the 
                redshifts in light from distant galaxies, and the time dilation of distant supernovae. Light is redshifted
                when its wavelength increases, and time dilation is an increase in duration. 
                So the observations include a stretching of length, and a stretching of time. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingspace"></canvas></p>

            <p>Light, an electromagnetic wave, would also be redshifted were the wave's period to increase somehow. Since the observed duration of a 
                distant supernovae is stretched, then it would follow that the duration of all similarly distant phenomena would be equally stretched, 
                including the oscillations of electromagnetic waves emitted from that distance.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider the interpretation that the observed redshifts are a change in the electromagnetic wave's period. 
                The evidence could then be stated as: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The elongated period of an electromagnetic wave</li>
                <li>The elongated duration of supernovae</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingtime"></canvas></p>

            <p>
                As a consequence of interpreting redshift like this, the two points of evidence appear fundamentally one-in-the-same, 
                with the suggestive hint that it has to do with some kind of dynamic of time, rather than of space.
            </p>

            <h2>Conjecture</h2>

            <p>
                The time dilation of supernovae is traditionally considered to be an effect of the expansion of space. Each photon coming from the supernova will 
                have to travel farther than the one before it, causing its observed duraton to be stretched.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis developed in this paper asks the reader to consider the possibility that what we are observing to happen, is actually happening. 
                Distant supernovae don't just appear time dilated; they are time dilated. The observed time dilation isn't an effect of expanding space, because 
                the expansion of space won't be necessary in a universe with time that possesses this dynamic characteristic.
                The conjecture can be summarized as <b>"the past is time dilated"</b>. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="200" height="400" id="justtime"></canvas></p>
            <script src="other/evidence.js"></script>

            <p>
                The next sections describe two attempts at developing this conjecture into a testable hypothesis. First in a purely ad hoc way, and then 
                with a geometrical foundation.
            </p>

            <h2>An ad hoc hypothesis</h2>

            <p>
                The scale factor \(a(t)\) plays a very important role in describing an expanding universe. 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) \]
            </p>


            <p>A length \(L\) in the past is its 
                current length times the scale factor: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[a(t) = \frac{L_{then}}{L_{now}} = \frac{\lambda_{emit}}{\lambda_{obs}} = \frac{1}{1+z}   \]
            </p>

            <p>
                And in a universe that expands very simply, such as a dark energy only universe: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[a(t) = e^{H_0t} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Consider what happens when a scale factor is applied to time instead of space.  
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - b(t)^2 c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The "time scale factor", \(b(t)\), describes the relationship between a duration \(T\) in the past and how it would 
                be observed in the present. 
                Given that frequency is the inverse of period: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[b(t) = \frac{T_{then}}{T_{now}} = \frac{f_{obs}}{f_{emit}} = \frac{1}{1+z}   \]
            </p>

            <p>
                And we'll use the same function to evaluate the time scale factor as we would in a simply expanding universe. 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[b(t) = e^{H_0t}  \]
            </p>

            <p>
                This metric form has no curvature and amounts to a transformation of the time coordinate in Minkowski spacetime. It cannot be 
                claimed to produce the effects of time dilation, or explain why it happens, which is why a geometrical solution 
                is pursued in the next section. For now, we just need to assume that the time dilation that is observed is really happening,
                and that the \(t\) coordinate measured by an observer shows those effects. Under those assumptions, we can use the following transformation
                to produce a time coordinate \(\tau\) that excludes the effects of time dilation: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = \frac{1}{H_0} ( e^{H_0t} - 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to note that \(t = 0 \) will always represent the present, and that all the measured time 
                coordinates used will be negative since cosmological observations are dealing with the past. Therefore \(\tau \leq 0 \) too.
                This means the exponent in the equation should always be zero or negative.
            </p>

            <p>
                Distances, on the other hand, should be regarded as positive values. 
                Since \(\tau \) gives us the "un-time dilated" time coordinate, we know that the physical distance \(d\) 
                to a source of light is \(d = -c\tau \). The time scale factor in terms of redshift \(z\) can be substituted into the transformation, giving:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = \frac{1}{H_0} \left(\frac{1}{1+z} - 1 \right) \]
                \[ \tau = -\frac{z}{1+z} \frac{1}{H_0}  \]
                \[ d =  \frac{z}{1+z} \frac{c}{H_0} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The light travel time distance, \(d_t = -ct \), will be longer than the physical distance due to the effects of time dilation, and 
                can be related to \(z\) by reversing the time transformation:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = e^{H_0t} \]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(H_0\tau + 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                And due to the time scale factor's relationship with redshift:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = \frac{1}{1+z} \]
                \[ H_0\tau = \frac{1}{1+z} - 1\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log \left(\frac{1}{1+z} - 1 + 1\right)\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log \left(\frac{1}{1+z}\right)\]
                \[ -ct = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
                \[ d_t = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                In this hypothesis, \(H_0\) no longer represents the expansion rate of the universe, but it still plays a familiar role in relating
                redshift to distance.
            </p>

            <h3>Compared to data</h3>

            <p>
                To test the hypothesis against the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, a distance modulus needs to be calculated from the redshift.
                A distance modulus can be obtained from a luminosity distance, for which we will use \(-ct(1+z)\), which accounts for the effects of time 
                dilation in the flux of the light source.
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/pantheonshoes_dm.png"></p>

            <p>
                To calculate a best fit for the hypothesis to determine a value for Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), we'll use this equation for the sum 
                of squared errors (SSE):
            </p>

            <p>
                \[\chi^2= \Sigma_i (\mu_i^{d} - \mu_i^{m})^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>where \( \mu_i^d \) is the distance modulus of the i-th supernova in the dataset, and \( \mu_i^m \) is the distance modulus 
                predicted by the model from the redshift z.
                The best fit to the data is the model with the lowest SSE.
                When an SSE is calculated for the hypothesis over a range of \(H_0\), the best fit is 70.4 km/s/Mpc. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sse.png"></p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis is also shown here to be a better fit to the data than the concordance model of cosmology, &Lambda;CDM.
                In fact, these calculations show that the hypothesis is a better fit to the supernovae data than any "flat" FLRW model 
                (\(\Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_M = 1\)), for any value of \(H_0\):
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sselcdm.png"></p>

            <p>
                Although lacking a geometrical foundation, the ad hoc hypothesis is simpler than the standard model of cosmology, and it's a better 
                fit for the supernovae data, which may be of some practical value as-is. However, in the tradition of general relativity,
                a solution that arises from an underlying geometry is preferred. 
            </p>


            <h2>A geometrical solution</h2>

            <p>
                The dimension of time is commonly considered to be the real number line, \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). 
                Let's suppose the dimension of time is instead curved in a circle, perhaps something like
                \(t\in\mathbb{S}^1\), where \( \mathbb{S}^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                As time passes in circular time, events that occur at a regular interval are evenly spaced along the circle's circumference. 
                From a point on the circle, the distance to each event in the 2D space by way of the Pythagorean theorem, however, will not be 
                evenly spaced. On the other side of the circle, the events will be bunched up. Were the time that we observe acting this way, it would be 
                time contracted and light would be blueshifted. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timecircle.png"></p>

            <p>
                Since those effects are the opposite of what we observe, consider time on the surface of a hyperbola rather than a circle.
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timehyperbola.png"></p>

            <p>
                Hyperbolic time, then, would seem to be able to produce time dilation and redshift of the past when observed from the present.
            </p>

            <p>
                As seen from the equation for physical distance, as \(z\) approaches infinity, \(d\) approaches \(c/H_0\). This means there is a cosmological 
                horizon at that distance. A spacetime that fits the description of closed, static space is de Sitter's original coordinates.
                The following figure and caption is from <a href="http://www.bourbaphy.fr/moschella.pdf">The de Sitter and anti-de Sitter Sightseeing Tour</a>:

                <blockquote>
                    In cosmology one usually “breaks” the general relativistic covariance and singles out a special coordinate
                    system: there is a natural choice of “cosmic time” that makes the universe appear spatially homogeneous and isotropic at large scales.

                given by three line elements, equations 8A, 8B, and 8C. On page 18 he says of the systems: 
                
                <blockquote>
                The system A satisfies the "material postulate of relativity of inertia," but it restricts the admissible transformation to those for 
                which at infinity t' = t, and thus introduces a quasi-absolute time, as has been explained in art. 2. In B and C the time is entirely 
                relative, and completely equivalent to the other three co-ordinates. ...<!--In A there is a world-matter, with which the whole world is filled,

                In B there may, or may not, be matter, but if there is more than one material particle these cannot be at rest, and if the world were

                system A, with g<sub>44</sub> = 1 for all values of the four co-ordinates.--> The system B satisfies the "mathematical postulate" of 
                relativity of inertia, which does not appear to admit of a simple physical interpretation.
                </blockquote>
                
            </p>

            <p>
                A possible physical interpretation of system B could be that the past is time dilated.

            <p>
                A "cosmic time" is not necessary in this hypothesis. There is the measured time coordinate of an observer,
                \(t\), which can be transformed to a coordinate, \(\tau\), that excludes the effects of time dilation. Having the freedom to choose
                how the time coordinate is defined in the geometry, by choosing a time coordinate that includes the effects of the time dilation 
                that we observe, space remains static and redshift occurs. The role of Hubble's constant is ultimately similar to 
                its role in FLRW, as the inverse of the radius of a hyperboloid. 
                <!--However, in the case of the hypothesis, it describes the curvature 
                of time rather than the expansion of space. -->
            </p>



            <h2>Cosmological implications</h2>

            <p>
                Time dilated supernovae and redshifted light are just two of the pieces of cosmological evidence we have available to us, and 
                the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset is just one dataset. As a redshift-distance relationship, the hypothesis is shown to be a better fit 
                to that dataset than the current standard model of cosmology. But for the broader body of cosmological evidence, the hypothesis 
                is unsatisfyingly silent.

            <h3>The Cosmic Microwave Background</h3>
            
            <p>
                The cosmic microwave background in particular has no immediate explanation in a universe that isn't expanding, and thus has no 
                conceivable beginning. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As the hypothesis sets a cosmological horizon at \(d=c/H_0\), the horizon itself could be a source of a thermal black body spectrum 
                due to Hawking radiation. The temperature of this radiation, though, is estimated to be far too low to even be considered 
                as the source of the CMB.  
                
            </p>

            
                
                For the hypothesis to be true without such an explanation, the CMB as a view of the universe in its infancy 
                would have to be mistaken. There is some evidence to suggest that the microwave radiation in question is not even of cosmological origin.
                Some correlation between features of the CMB and the solar system, the so-called 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_of_evil_(cosmology)">"Axis of Evil"</a>, have been observed, 
                as well as an anomalous cold spot and very 
                slight difference in temperatures between hemispheres. Additionally, the CMB suggests 
                <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/aca51f">"the Universe was close to thermal
                and chemical equilibrium — a state of very high entropy — a mere ~377,700 years after the Big Bang."</a> This seems to conflict
                with the low entropy state of the universe we observe today.
            </p>

            <p>
                For the hypothesis to be plausible, the evidence of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO) in galaxy distributions would have to be found 
                insignificant, as well as evidence for the integrated Wolfe-Sachs effect.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, the general notion of a description of the beginning of our universe would have to be discarded. The hypothesis places a horizon 
                on our observable region of the universe, but says basically nothing about the universe at large. That would be a rather disappointing conclusion
                after nearly a century of promise of the contrary.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Such a conclusion, however, would vindicate Edwin Hubble's rejection of the expanding universe.
