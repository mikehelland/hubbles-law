<h1>Cosmic Microwave Background</h1>

<p>The expanding universe theory is said to have predicted the Cosmic Microwave Background.</p>


1896 – Charles Édouard Guillaume estimates the "radiation of the stars" to be 5–6K.[110]
1926 – Sir Arthur Eddington estimates the non-thermal radiation of starlight in the galaxy "... by the formula E = σT4 the effective temperature corresponding to this density is 3.18° absolute ... black body"[111]
1930s – Cosmologist Erich Regener calculates that the non-thermal spectrum of cosmic rays in the galaxy has an effective temperature of 2.8 K
1941 – Andrew McKellar detected the cosmic microwave background as the coldest component of the interstellar medium by using the excitation of CN doublet lines measured by W. S. Adams in a B star, finding an "effective temperature of space" (the average bolometric temperature) of 2.3 K[32][116]
1946 – Robert Dicke predicts "... radiation from cosmic matter" at <20 K, but did not refer to background radiation [112]
1948 – Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman estimate "the temperature in the universe" at 5 K. Although they do not specifically mention microwave background radiation, it may be inferred.[117]
1949 – Ralph Alpher and Robert Herman re-re-estimate the temperature at 28 K.
1953 – Erwin Finlay-Freundlich in support of his tired light theory, derives a blackbody temperature for intergalactic space of 2.3K [115] with comment from Max Born suggesting radio astronomy as the arbitrator between expanding and infinite cosmologies.
1953 – George Gamow estimates 7 K.[112]
1956 – George Gamow estimates 6 K.[112]
1955 – Émile Le Roux of the Nançay Radio Observatory, in a sky survey at λ = 33 cm, reported a near-isotropic background radiation of 3 kelvins, plus or minus 2.[112]
1957 – Tigran Shmaonov reports that "the absolute effective temperature of the radioemission background ... is 4±3 K".[118] It is noted that the "measurements showed that radiation intensity was independent of either time or direction of observation ... it is now clear that Shmaonov did observe the cosmic microwave background at a wavelength of 3.2 cm"[119][120]
1960s – Robert Dicke re-estimates a microwave background radiation temperature of 40 K[112][121]
1964 – A. G. Doroshkevich and Igor Dmitrievich Novikov publish a brief paper suggesting microwave searches for the black-body radiation predicted by Gamow, Alpher, and Herman, where they name the CMB radiation phenomenon as detectable.[122]
1964–65 – Arno Penzias and Robert Woodrow Wilson measure the temperature to be approximately 3 K. Robert Dicke, James Peebles, P. G. Roll, and D. T. Wilkinson interpret this radiation as a signature of the big bang.

    <li>1924: Edwin Hubble confirms galaxies are star systems far beyond the Milky Way</li>
    <li>1926: Sir Arthur Eddington predicts the temperature of space to be 3K</li>
    <li>1929: Hubble publishes the redshift-distance relation</li>
    <li>1933: Eddington updates his prediction to 2.8K</li>
    <li>1946: George Gamow predicts an "afterglow" </li>

    
</ul>
<p>To understand why, imagine you have a laser, and you shoot a laser beam into space.</p>

<p>Now imagine the laser beam passes a series of targets you've placed in space, each 200 million light years apart.</p>

<p>In a simple universe, the laser beam will reach the first target in 200 million years, the second target in 400 million light years, and so on.</p>

<div id="staticModel"></div>

<p>But we don't live in such a simple universe. We observe cosmological redshifts, which are interpreted as galaxies moving away from us in an expanding universe.</p>

<p>The question is then, how fast is the universe expanding?</p>

<p>Based on observations, a target that begins 13.8 billion light years away would be 46.6 billion light years away by the time the laser beam caught up with it. 
    Also, a target that started 5.5 billion light years away would be 11 billion light years away when the laser beam got to it.
    Those are the white points on the graph.</p>

<p>If Hubble's Law is v = H &times; D, where v is the apparent recessional velocity of the target, H is Hubble's Constant, and D is the comoving distance of the target, then what should H be?</p>

<p>If H is 0.00009 light years / year / million light years, the near-by data point can be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingFast"></div>

<p>If H is 0.000051 light years / year / million light years, the far data point can be reached.</p>

<div id="expandingSlow"></div>

<p>There isn't a single value for H that can be used in this model to reach both data points.</p>

<p>The problem isn't really Hubble's Constant. The problem is the interpretation of redshift and the version of Hubble's Law being used.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble said that it was convenient for the redshift to be interpreted as a Doppler-like effect, leading to the expanding universe theory. 
    He said the redshifts might also be interpreted as how nature actually works: 
    there isn't another phenomenon causing the redshifts; the redshifts are a new phenomenon in themselves. 
    However, he noted, if there are existing ways to explain the redshift, adding new principles of nature should be avoided.</p>

<blockquote>When first observed the red-shifts were immediately attributed to radial motion away from the observer, to recession of the nebulae. 
    This interpretation still remains the only permissible explanation that is known. 
    It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would 
    be conspicuous and, actually, are not found. 
    We may state with some confidence that <b>red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else they represent some unrecognized principle of nature.</b>
    We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, 
    familiar principle by an ad hoc explanation <b>unless we are forced to that step by actual observations.</b>

    <br>

</blockquote>
    

<p>But the path of the familiar principles has led us to propose new principles anyways: accelerating expansion, dark energy, the inflation period, the multiverse. 
    We are clearly past the point of being forced to create new principles of physics.</p>

<p>Therefore, consider a literal interpretation of the law of redshifts:</p>

<blockquote>the law of red-shfts - the observed fact that light from a distant galaxy loses energy proportionally to the distance of the galaxy. 
    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 18, 1937
</blockquote>

<p>I've devised two hypotheses based on a literal interpretation of the redshifts to test.</p>

<p><b>Hypothesis 1: the speed of light = c - H &times; D</b></p>

<div id="redshift1"></div>

<p><b>Hypothesis 2: the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)</b></p>

<div id="redshift2"></div>

<p>Note that Hypothesis 2 hits both data points.</p>

<p>In these models, the laser beam's speed diminishes as its distance from its source increases. The speed of a wave is its frequency &times; wavelength. 
    And the energy of a photon is its frequency &times; Planck's constant. We observe redshifts, which are a drop in frequency and energy. 
    Taken literally, that would also drop the laser beam's speed.</p>

<p>From this data and the models considered, Hypothesis 2 appears to be the real Hubble's Law. In such a universe, space is not expanding, there is no dark energy, 
    there is no age or size of the universe, and Hubble's Constant is a consistent 0.00035 Mly<sup>-1</sup>. </p>

<p>Hubble's Law should be:</p>

<blockquote>the speed of light = c / (1 + H &times; D)</blockquote>

<p>Note that H is independent of the units of c. A unit of inverse length for H means the denominator (1 + H &times; D) is unitless.</p>

<p>
    This conclusion raises questions that must be addressed that include:
    <ul>
        <li>Isn't the expansion of the universe a fact?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</li>
        <li>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</li>
        <li>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</li>
        <li>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light Theory?</li>
        <li>What about the Cosmic Microwave Background?</li>
        <li>... more to come as questions come in</li>
    </ul>
    These are addressed below.
</p>

<h4>Isn't the expansion of the universe a fact?</h4>

<p>Not exactly. The <i>redshifts</i> are an observed fact. The redshifts may be interpreted as motion, which leads to the expansion of the universe as a 
    hypothetical consequence. If every galaxy is moving away from our galaxy, that would put our galaxy in some special spot in the universe. 
    But if every galaxy is moving away from every galaxy, we would be in a normal galaxy in a universe that expands. </p>

<p>The theoretical expansion of the universe has hypothetical consequences of its own: a small, young universe dominated by dark energy, dark matter.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble never accepted the expanding theory as a fact. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, 
    but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, 
    that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents <b>the observable region as an 
    insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time</b>. 

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 47, 1937 (emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>Much has changed since his day though. From the 30's to the 60's the expanding models were very simple. A point that expands.</p>

<img src="img/expansion_classic.jpg">

<p>But in the 70's problems began to emerge.</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These problems lead to the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">inflation.</a> 
    The universe blows up super fast in the first nanosecond after the big bang, then chills out. Then in 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe">accelerating.</a></p>

<p>Today, the expanding theory of the universe looks like this:</p>

<img width="700px" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg">

<p>If the benefit of the expanding universe theory is, as Hubble wrote, that interpreting redshifts as motion didn't require any new physics, 
    then the expanding theory gave away that benefit decades ago. </p>

<p>To make the problem worse, as we peer into the "early universe", we don't see only young galaxies. We see mature systems like the ones around us.</p>

<ul>

    <li>More <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BigBangSkeptics">here.</a>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons and others, the widely accepted expansion theory is facing increasing criticism. Here's a sampling.</p>

    <li>More <a href="http://cosmology.info/resources/index.html">here.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, the <i>redshifts</i> of distant galaxies are observed facts. The motion of those galaxies and expansion of space are theoretical interpretations of the facts.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</h4>

<p>Yes, when light has traveled for millions of years, its speed will be less than c.</p>

<p>But our experiments and measurements don't last millions of years. In our experiments, H &times; D is so small, it can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So if:</p>

<pre>
    v_light = c / (1 + H &times; D)
    
    and:
    
    H &times; D = 0
    
    then:
    
    v_light = c / (1 + 0)
    
    v_light = c
</pre>

<p>In which case there shouldn't be any conflict with special relativity in the domain where the redshifts don't appear.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Shouldn't we be able to measure a drop in a photon's speed?</h4>

<p>The task would be to come up with a clever way to measure the speed of ancient light without disturbing the photon.</p>

<p>Say that light travels for hundreds of millions of years, and slows to below c, and then hits your telescope's lens.</p>

<p>At the quantum level, the photon will have been <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/mod5.html">absorbed by atoms</a> in the lens. 
    Then a new photon, or maybe the old one, is emitted and focused to your telescope's eyepiece.</p>

<p>The photon may have traveled great distances from its source before it encountered your telescope, 
    but the light inside the telescope will be very close to its source: the lens that focused it. 
    The D of the photons in the telescope will not be millions of light years, but rather a few dozen centimeters.</p>

<p>Thus, any light that we interact with will presumably be moving at c / (1 + H &times; 0), or just c.</p>

<p>If there was a way to measure the speed of ancient light without interacting with it, that would make a good test of the hypothesis. </p>

<hr>

<h4>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</h4>

<p>In the specific model demonstrated here, yes, energy is lost. 
    It could be that the energy deducted from the photon is deposited in space as it travels. </p>

<p>But I will let the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a> do the talking on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
    The thing about photons is that they redshift, losing energy as space expands. 
    If we keep track of a certain fixed number of photons, the number stays constant while the energy per photon decreases, 
    so the total energy decreases. A decrease in energy is just as much a “violation of energy conservation” as an increase in energy, 
    but it doesn’t seem to bother people as much. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how bothersome it is, of course — it’s a 
    crystal-clear prediction of general relativity.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/">https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2010/02/22/energy-is-not-conserved/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>In an expanding universe, photons redshift and energy is lost.</p>

<p>Under the literal interpretation of redshifts, however, energy is lost or it might be deposited throughout space. 
    The photon could simply decay into tiny particles left in its path after 14 billion years.</p>

<p>Either way, if lost energy is an issue, then the expanding universe theory has the same issue.</p>

<hr>

<h4>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light Theory?</h4>

<p>In 1929, just after Hubble published the redshift-distance relation, Fritz Zwicky proposed that a type of gravitational drag was causing the redshift, 
    not an expanding universe. </p>

<p>However, such an effect would lead to a blurring of the light, which is not observed. Referring to an earlier quote, as Hubble said in 1937:</p>

<blockquote>
    It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would 
    be conspicuous and, actually, are not found.
    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 22, 1937 
</blockquote>

<p>In Hypothesis 1 and 2, under the literal interpretation of redshift, light does figuratively "get tired", but not because space expands, or the intergalactic medium, 
    or matter dragging on it. Redshifts are observed, and they are interpreted as their own phenomena in nature. </p>

<p>In Zwicky's Tired Light model, light loses energy but still travels at c. 
    This is represented by the red dots in the graph: a static universe with a universally constant speed of light. 
    This model does not hit either of the two data points aimed for.</p>

<p>The hypotheses presented here, represented by the green and magenta dots in the graph, are mathematically distinct from Zwicky's Tired Light. 
    The magenta line does connect the desired data points, which no other interpretation can claim.</p>

<p>So this is not Zwicky's Tired Light Theory. This is an even more literal interpretation of redshift and a novel mathematical model.</p>
