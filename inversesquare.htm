        <h1>Hubble's Law as an Inverse Square</h1>
        
        <p>According to Hubble's law, objects move away from each other proportionally with distance.</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Model 1</b>: v=H<sub>0</sub>D</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            One feature of such a universe is that the travel time from one place to another increases with distance.
            If you were to shine a laser toward a target 100 million light years away, it would take longer than 100 million years 
            for the laser beam to reach the target. The expansion of space moves the target farther away, meaning the light has new space to travel through, 
            which takes more time.
        </p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/vcHD.gif"></p>

        <p>
            An alternative cosmology that can produce the exact same time delays without the expansion of space requires that
            the photon will indeed lose energy and speed during intergalactic journeys. 
            If a photon loses speed when it redshifts, its travel time to a target in space will also increase, despite the target remaining stationary.
            This cosmology is shown in green in the image above, given by a variation on Hubble's law:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><b>Model 2</b>: v=c-H<sub>0</sub>D</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Since <a href="modeling_expansion.htm">model 1 and model 2 produce the exact same time delays and redshifts</a>, they are both in conflict with 
            the observation that the expansion of space is accelerating. There appears to be more redshifting in the nearby universe than farther away
        </p>

        <p>
            To address this in the standard model of cosmology, a new concept is introduced called dark energy. This has the effect
            that Hubble's constant isn't actually constant, but changes with time:
        </p>
            
        <ul>
            <li><b>Model 3</b>: dark energy</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The alternative cosmology offers other options. In model 2, the speed of a photon begins at c and decreases with distance.
            It does this by subtracting H<sub>0</sub>D from c. But there are other ways to do this. It could divide c by (1+H<sub>0</sub>D). 
            The photon would still start at c, and it would still decelerate with distance. Just along a different curve. 
        </p>

        <p>This opens up a whole new class of hypotheses to try. One of them, an inverse square law, 
            produces a decent fit of the data from the Supernovae Cosmology project:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Model 4</b>: v=c / (1+H<sub>0</sub>D)<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/supernovae.png"></p>

        <p>
            In this model, H<sub>0</sub> is still constant throughout time, however it has different units. 
            The line shown is using a value of H<sub>0</sub>=0.04 Gly<sup>-1</sup>.
            The inverse distance and distance units cancel out in the denominator.
        </p>

        <p>Based on the success of the inverse square hypothesis, an analog for an expanding universe can be stated as thus:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><b>Model 5</b>: v=c - c / (1+H<sub>0</sub>D)<sup>2</sup></li>
        </ul>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sn_expanding.png"></p>

        <p>Model 4 and model 5 fit the acceleration well by changing Hubble's law into an inverse square law. 
        </p>
