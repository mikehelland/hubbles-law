* $H$ - constant with dimension inverse time

* $t$ - Measured time, has time dilation

$$-\infty < t \leq 0$$

* $\tau$ - Minkowski time, time dilation removed

$$-H^{-1} \leq \tau \leq 0$$

$$\tau = H^{-1} (e^{Ht} - 1)$$

* $r$ - Physical distance

$$r = -c\tau = \frac{c}{H} \frac{z}{1+z}$$

* $-ct$ - the speed of light x measured time. This value isn't particularly physically meaningful. In standard cosmology, it would be the "light travel time distance." In my model, it's just the "time-dilated light travel time distance" which doesn't actually tell us much about anything, but is used to find a luminosity distance.

$$-ct = -\frac{c}{H} \log (H\tau+1) = \frac{c}{H} \log (1+z)$$

* $d_L$ - luminosity distance. This is a hypothetical distance that essentially says, imagine a universe without expansion or time dilation, or tired light or variable mass. How far away would something be in a plain vanilla spacetime, to look like it does in our spacetime? 

$$d_L = -ct(1+z) = \frac{c}{H} (1+z) \log (1+z)$$
