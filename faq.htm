<h2>Isn't the expansion of the universe a fact?</h2>

<p>Not exactly. The <i><a href="redshift.htm">redshifts</a></i> are an observed fact. The redshifts may be interpreted as motion, which leads to the expansion of the universe as a 
    hypothetical consequence. If every galaxy is moving away from our galaxy, that would put our galaxy in some special spot in the universe. 
    But if every galaxy is moving away from every galaxy, we would be in a normal galaxy in an expanding universe. </p>

<p>The theoretical expansion of the universe has hypothetical consequences of its own: a small, young universe dominated by dark energy, dark matter.</p>

<p>Edwin Hubble never accepted the expanding theory as a fact. He wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
    The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, 
    but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, 
    that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents <b>the observable region as an 
    insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time</b>. 

    <br>
    <br>
    E. Hubble, <a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf">The Observational Approach to Cosmology</a>, pg. 47, 1937 (emphasis added)
</blockquote>

<p>Much has changed since his day though. From the 30's through the 60's, the universe was thought to have begun as a point that grew out consistently.</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/expansion_classic.jpg"></p>

<p>But in the 1970's problems began to emerge. To make a software analogy, there were a lot of bugs that needed patching. Such as:</p>

<ul>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These problems lead to the theory of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_(cosmology)">inflation.</a> 
    The universe blows up super fast in the first nanosecond after the big bang, then chills out. Then in 1998, it was discovered that the expansion of the universe is 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accelerating_expansion_of_the_universe">accelerating.</a></p>

<p>Today, the expanding theory of the universe looks like this:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img width="700px" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg"></p>

<p>If the benefit of interpreting redshifts as motion is that it doesn't require any new physics, 
    then the expanding theory gave that benefit away decades ago. </p>

<p>To make the problem worse, as we peer into the "early universe", we don't see only young galaxies. We see mature systems like the ones around us.</p>

    <li>More <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BigBangSkeptics">here.</a>
</ul>

<p>For these reasons and others, the widely accepted expansion theory is increasingly being compared to outdated software: 
    burdened by outlandish patches and still full of bugs.
    Here's a sample:</p>

<ul>
    <li>1995: <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/377099a0">Nature: Big Bang not yet dead but in decline</a></li>

    <li>More <a href="http://cosmology.info/resources/index.html">here.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In any case, the <i>redshifts</i> of distant galaxies are observed facts. The motion of those galaxies and the expansion of space are theoretical interpretations of the facts.</p>

<h2>Doesn't the Cosmic Microwave Background confirm an expanding universe?</h2>

<p>The expanding universe theory predicts we observe the same background temperature in all directions.</p>

<p>This prediction seemed to hold until 2003 when anomalies appeared, which were confirmed in 2013:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmb.jpg"></p>
<blockquote>
    Two Cosmic Microwave Background anomalous features hinted at by Planck's predecessor, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), 
    are confirmed in the new high precision data from Planck.  One is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the 
    sky (indicated by the curved line), with slightly higher average temperatures in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and slightly lower 
    average temperatures in the northern ecliptic hemisphere. <b>This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe 
    should be broadly similar in any direction we look.</b> There is also a cold spot that extends over a patch of sky that is much larger 
    than expected (circled). In this image the anomalous regions have been enhanced with red and blue shading to make them more clearly visible.

    <br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/planck/-/51559-hemispheric-asymmetry-and-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background">
        https://sci.esa.int/web/planck/-/51559-hemispheric-asymmetry-and-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background</a>
</blockquote>

<p>This raises the question of where the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMB_cold_spot">CMB Cold Spot</a> might appear to other observers.</p>

<p>For instance, imagine observers at the north and south poles of our observable universe:</p>

<p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmbobservers.png"></p>

<p>We see a cold spot to the south. Does the south observer see a cold spot to their south? Does the north observer see the same CMB anomalies as we do?</p>

<p>This is a question the expanding universe theory doesn't have a clear answer for.</p>

<p>However, if the observable region is, as Hubble puts it, "an insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time",
    then there are no anomalies or questions. The cold spot is to <i>our</i> south, but to the southern observer the cold spot is in their vicinity. </p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that before the expanding theory even existed, Arthur Eddington 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background#Timeline_of_prediction,_discovery_and_interpretation">
        calculated the temperature of starlight in our galaxy to be 3.18 Kelvin</a>. As such, the CMB may just be photons limping in 
        from galaxies 14 billion light years away, right before the temperature of space takes over our measurements. </p>

<a name="special-relativity"></a>
<h2>Doesn't this conflict with special relativity?</h2>

<p>Yes. The hypothesis is that the speed of light decreases with distance from the source, which is noticeable after traveling millions of years.</p>

<p>Special relativity tells us that light travels at <code>c</code> over all distances, even after millions and billions of years. </p> 

<p>But our experiments don't last millions of years. In our experiments, H &times; D is so small, it can be considered zero.</p>

<p>So if:</p>

<pre>
    v_light = c / (1 + H &times; D)
    
    and:
    
    H &times; D = 0
    
    then:
    
    v_light = c / (1 + 0)
    
    v_light = c
</pre>

<p>In which case there shouldn't be any conflict with special relativity in the domain where the redshifts don't appear.</p>

<hr>

<a name="conservation-of-energy"></a>
<h2>Doesn't this violate the Conservation of Energy?</h2>

<p>In the specific model demonstrated here, yes, energy is lost. 
    It could be that the energy deducted from the photon is deposited in space as it travels. </p>

<p>But I will let the esteemed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_M._Carroll">Sean Carroll</a> do the talking on this one.</p>

<blockquote>
    The thing about photons is that they redshift, losing energy as space expands. 
    If we keep track of a certain fixed number of photons, the number stays constant while the energy per photon decreases, 
    so the total energy decreases. A decrease in energy is just as much a “violation of energy conservation” as an increase in energy, 
    but it doesn’t seem to bother people as much. At the end of the day it doesn’t matter how bothersome it is, of course — it’s a 
    crystal-clear prediction of general relativity.

    <br>
    <br>

</blockquote>

<p>In an expanding universe, photons redshift and energy is lost.</p>

<p>Under the literal interpretation of redshifts, however, energy could be lost, or it could be deposited throughout space. 
    The photon could simply decay into tiny particles left in its path after 14 billion years.</p>

<a name="tired-light"></a>
<h2>Isn't this the discredited Tired Light theory?</h2>

<p>There have been 
    <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1981A%26AS...45..129R/abstract">hundreds of theories</a> that don't involve expanding space
    trying to explain how light gets "tired" during long intergalactic journeys, 
    starting all the way back to 1929 when the redshift-distance relation was first published.
</p>

<p>Tired light theories fail because they don't
    account for enough redshift, they can't explain the distance factor, or the redshifts are caused in a way that would include other observable results, 
    which ultimately are not observed.</p>

<p>In general, tired light theories have the following in common:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Some other phenomenon causes the redshifts</li>
    <li>Light, even though it's "tired", still travels at <code>c</code></li>
    <li>They are represented by the blue line on the graph, matching a simple static model</li> 
</ul>

<p>The hypothesis that light's speed is inversely proportional to the distance from its source is different:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Nothing causes the redshifts, they are as fundamental to nature as inertia</li>
    <li>Light travels at less than <code>c</code> after millions of years</li>
    <li>The time it takes light to reach a target is similar to the expanding model</li> 
</ul>

<p>It should come as no surprise to us that there are fundamental laws of nature we would only detect once we had telescopes
    that can see what's out beyond the Milky Way.</p>

<p>If dark energy, which hasn't been observed, is in the consideration as a possible fundamental ingredient of nature, 
    then the actual observations that led to its conjecture, cosmological redshift, should be considered a worthy candidate as well.

<a name="vsl"></a>
<h2>Is this a Varying Speed of Light theory?</h2>

<p>In the last decade there have been versions of a theory going around known as Varying Speed of Light (VSL):</p>

<blockquote>
    There are others that think such dark energy ideas are now getting too convoluted, and that a much simpler explanation, one that even Einstein considered, should now be given serious consideration; a change in the speed of light, or VSL (Varying Speed of Light) as others know it by.
<br>
<br>
“The ‘tension’ between measurements of the Hubble-Lemaire constant, H0, (which is known to be changing over time) shows that old theories of the Universe are missing something. If H0 was the lower value of 67 km/sec/Mpc, much or all of the so-called acceleration would vanish. The differing values may be explained if the speed of light has changed between the early and late universe,” said Louise Riofrio, an author and scientist who now works at an observatory association in Hawaii.

</blockquote>

<p>In VSL theories:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>c</code> changes</li>
    <li><i>All</i> photons in the universe slow to the same speed </li>
    <li>Space is expanding</li>
    <li>Intends to represent the accelerating rate of expansion</li>
</ul>

<p>The hypothesis in this paper is different:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>c</code> is constant</li>
    <li><i>Individual</i> photons slow down according to their own history, not the universe's</li>
    <li>Space is not expanding</li>
    <li>Intends to represent cosmological redshift</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the hypothesis presented in this paper, the speed of light <i>does</i> vary, and light <i>does</i> get tired, 
    but it does so in a way that is conceptually and mathematically unique to the established 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_speed_of_light">Varying Speed of Light</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tired_light">Tired Light</a> theories.</p>
