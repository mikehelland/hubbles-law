Redshift-distance analogs to Hubble's law


Introduction

A photon traveling in static space, at a constant speed, against a steady clock for one year will travel a distance of 1 light year and arrive with the same energy as when it left. The redshift-distance relationship tells us that over cosmological scales, the energy actually decreases. The redshifts are commonly interpreted as being caused by the observed object's recessional velocity, which is expressed by Hubble's law. That all galaxies are moving away from each other leads to the conclusion that space is expanding, so space is dynamic rather than static. Due to the expansion of space, a photon that sets out for a target 1 billion light years away will take longer than 1 billion years to reach that target, since the target will have moved away during the trip.

The same increase in light travel time introduced by dynamic space can alternatively be attained either by making the photon's speed dynamic, or by making the rate of the clock by which the journey is measured dynamic. A photon with a variable speed is incompatible with the laws of physics, and is presented only as a toy model. A dynamic clock rate, however, is already a consequence of space being dynamic.

In an expanding universe, each tick of a distant clock will occur at a farther distance than the previous tick. This has been observed as time dilation in the light curves of type SN1a supernovae. The rate a distant clock ticks is 1 / (1 + z).

This paper postulates that distant clocks in static space tick at a rate of 1 / (1 + z), and it examines the cosmological phenomena that can be explained by this postulate alone.


Models

Consider three models, each with a photon at a starting point and target in space. Each photon faces a particular challenge. The first photon is traveling toward a target that is moving away from it. The second photon does not maintain its top speed and decelerates. The third photon's time to the target is measured by a clock that speeds up with distance. They are described by these equations:

model 1: v = Hd
model 2: v_photon = c - Hd
model 3: t = c / (c - Hd)

The first model is Hubble's law, where v is the recessional velocity of a target at distance d, and H is Hubble's constant. The second and third models are variations of the first. 

A simple computer program (Listing 1) demonstrates that all three models predict the same travel time for a target at any distance d, as shown in Fig. 1.

Redshift

The computer program in Listing 1. also computes the photon's redshift at each distance. For model 1, that's done by elongating the photon's wavelength. To account for the effect of Hubble flow in the model, the photon's velocity (v_photon) is: 

v_photon = c + Hd

Using this velocity a new wavelength (w_obs) can be calculated, given its original wavelength (w_emit):

w_obs = w_emit * (c + Hd) / c

With w_obs and w_emit, a redshift (z) can be calculated.

1 + z = w_obs / w_emit

In model 2, v_photon = c - Hd. It's z can be calculated by finding a new frequency (f_obs) based on its original frequency (f_emit). 

f_obs = f_emit * (c - Hd) / c 

In model 3, the clock rate depends on the distance of the photon has traveled:

t = c / (c - Hd)

Since frequency is 1 / t:

f_obs = f_emit * (c - Hd) / c

The results are that all three models predict the same redshift z for the same distance d.
