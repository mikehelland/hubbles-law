        <h3>Redshift and Hubble tension</h3>

        <h3>Age and size of the universe</h3>

        <p>If the universe started with a Big Bang, as we look back in space and time, 
            we should be seeing fewer and fewer mature galaxies, and eventually only young galaxies. 
            In the 21st century observations show that's not true:</p>


        <ul>

            <li>Lots more <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/BigBangSkeptics">here.</a>
        </ul>

        <p>The size of the things we observe in the universe doesn't seem to be constrained by what we assume are the theoretical limits they could reach
            given the age and size of the universe. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_cosmic_structures">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

        <img width="900px" src="img/size_limit.png">
    
        <p>And then there's the weird coincidence that the age of the universe is about equal c/H, the 
            radius of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_volume">the Hubble Volume</a>. 
            If we were living 5 billion years ago, or 5 billion years from now, the age of the universe and Hubble's radius would be unrelated.
            By <i>pure</i> coincidence, we are living when they match.</p>

        <h3>The CMB</h3>

        <p>You may have heard that the Big Bang theory predicted the CMB. That's sort of true. 
            The Big Bang predicted a black body radition, which was right, although not at the right temperature.</p>

        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmb_predictions.png"></p>

        <p>CMB was discovered in 1964 at 3K. The most accurate preditions for the background temperature of space were based on a stationary universe, not an expanding one.</p>
        
        <p>That's not a deal breaker, but it's a major coincidence. </p>
        <p>If we were living 5 billion years from now, or 5 billion years in the past, the CMB would be a different temperature according to the Big Bang.
            It's apparently just a <i>pure coincidence</i> that the CMB is the same temperature today as the minimum temperature for stuff in our galaxy.</p>

        <p>All of that could be ignored, but in the last decade anomalies have been spotted in the CMB. It's cooler to one side than the other.</p>

        <blockquote>
            Two Cosmic Microwave Background anomalous features hinted at by Planck's predecessor, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), 
            are confirmed in the new high precision data from Planck.  One is an asymmetry in the average temperatures on opposite hemispheres of the 
            sky, with slightly higher average temperatures in the southern ecliptic hemisphere and slightly lower 
            average temperatures in the northern ecliptic hemisphere. <b>This runs counter to the prediction made by the standard model that the Universe 
            should be broadly similar in any direction we look.</b> There is also a cold spot that extends over a patch of sky that is much larger 
            than expected. 
            <br>

                https://sci.esa.int/web/planck/-/51559-hemispheric-asymmetry-and-cold-spot-in-the-cosmic-microwave-background</a>
        </blockquote>
        
        <p>The CMB is predicted to be the same temperature in all directions. It is not.</p>

        <p>We see a cold spot to the south. In the diagram, does the south observer see a cold spot to their south? 
            Does the north observer see the same CMB anomalies as we do?</p>
        
        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/cmbobservers.png"></p>
        
        <p>This is a question the expanding universe theory doesn't have a clear answer for.</p>
        
        <p>However, if the observable region is, as Hubble puts it, "an insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time",
            then there are no anomalies or questions. The cold spot is to <i>our</i> south, but to the southern observer the cold spot is in their vicinity. </p>
        
        <h3>Tolman Surface Brightness Test</h3>

        <p>The Tolman Surface Brightness Test is meant to distinguish a static universe from an expanding one.</p>

        <p>An expanding universe predicts an extra factor of dimming, due to the photons arriving at a lower rate due to the galaxy's motion away from us.</p>
            
        <blockquote>"The exponent found is not 4 as expected in the simplest expanding model, but 2.6 or 3.4, depending on the frequency band."
            <br>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman_surface_brightness_test">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolman_surface_brightness_test</a>
        </blockquote>
    
        <h3>Dark Principles</h3>

        <p>The Big Bang originally was about the universe expanding presently, and thus growing from a single point in the past:</p>
        
        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/expansion_classic.jpg"></p>

        <p>That model broke in the 1970's. To make a software analogy, there were a lot of bugs that needed patching. Such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>They came up with a cool trick to solve this problem: cram 1 trillion years of expansion into a single nanosecond, called inflation:</p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="700px" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg"></p>

        <p>For these reasons and others, the widely accepted expansion theory is increasingly being compared to outdated software: 
            burdened by outlandish patches and still full of bugs:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>The big bang today relies on a growing number of hypothetical entities, things that we have never observed -- inflation, dark matter and dark energy are the most prominent examples. Without them, there would be a fatal contradiction between the observations made by astronomers and the predictions of the big bang theory. In no other field of physics would this continual recourse to new hypothetical objects be accepted as a way of bridging the gap between theory and observation. It would, at the least, raise serious questions about the validity of the underlying theory.
            <br>
            <br>
            What is more, the big bang theory can boast of no quantitative predictions that have subsequently been validated by observation. The successes claimed by the theory's supporters consist of its ability to retrospectively fit observations with a steadily increasing array of adjustable parameters, just as the old Earth-centered cosmology of Ptolemy needed layer upon layer of epicycles.

            <h2>Part 2: The History</h2>

            <p>It might seem like there's no way science could be wrong about something like this, 
                but when considering the history of the idea, it's not difficult to see why things 
                turned out the way they did.</p>

            <p>To start, prior to the 1920's, we didn't know about galaxies beyond the Milky Way. 
                The part of the universe we could observe consisted of the stars closest to us, the Milky Way.
                That was about 100,000 light years across. 
                
            <p>Edwin Hubble showed in 1926 that these "nebulae" things are what we now call galaxies,
                pushing the observable region out to millions and billions of light years.</p>
                
            <p>In 1929, Hubble's redshift-distance relation was published, and many immediately interpreted this as 
                galaxies moving away from us, that could only mean the expansion of the universe.</p>

            <p>Hubble himself was never actually convinced of this. In 1937 he wrote:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, 
                but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, 
                that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents the observable region as an 
                insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time. </i>

                <br>
                - Edwin Hubble
            </blockquote>

            <p>And in December of 1941, he announced that <a href="img/paper1941.png">he had refuted the expanding universe theory</a>.<p>

            <p>Since science doesn't exist in a vacuum, and America was entering WWII at that exact time, the telescopes and galaxies had to wait.
                Hubble was assigned to 
                <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hubble-edwin-1889-1953">work 
                    in a wind tunnel for the war effort</a>.</p>


            <p>Once the war was over, and the study of the galaxies resumed, the debate on expansion of the universe
                largely did not. Even the "Steady State Universe" that competed with the Big Bang includes the expansion of space (despite what
                one might think from its name).</p>

            <p>And ultimately, the physicists of the 20th century were completely justified in thinking the universe was expanding. 
                The evidence presented in Part 1 is from the 21st century.</p>

            <p>20th century physicists had two real options:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>space was expanding</li>
                <li>something as fundamental as inertia may not go out to infinity</li>
            </ol>

            <p>As long as option 1 seemed viable, option 2 would be far too drastic. The expansion of space seemed like a good idea, 
                which didn't require anything as crazy as putting limits on inertia. Nothing that crazy...  at first.
            </p>

            <p>The Big Bang is about 90 years old now, and a lot of crazy things have happened. Dark energy, the multiverse, CMB anomalies, oh, 
                and not being able to measure the rate of expansion accurately.</p>

            <p>Well, we have two options too.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>keep going forward on this path</li>
                <li>back up</li>
            </ol>
