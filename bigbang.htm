        <h1>History of the Big Bang</h1>

        <h3>1930-1979</h3>

        <p>The Big Bang originally was about the universe expanding presently, and thus growing from a single point in the past:</p>
        
        <p class="pimg"><img src="img/expansion_classic.jpg"></p>

        <h3>1980-present</h3>

        <p>The old model broke in the 1970's. To make a software analogy, there were a lot of bugs that needed patching. Such as:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">Horizon Problem</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">Flatness Problem</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">Magnetic Monopole Problem</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>They came up with a cool trick to solve this problem: cram 1 trillion years of expansion into a single nanosecond, called inflation:</p>

        <p class="pimg"><img width="700px" src="img/cosmicinflation.jpg"></p>

        <p>For these reasons and others, the widely accepted expansion theory is increasingly being compared to outdated software: 
            burdened by outlandish patches and still full of bugs:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>In its original form, an expanding Einstein model had an attractive, economic elegance. Alas, it has since run into serious difficulties, 
                which have been cured only by sticking on some ugly bandages: inflation to cover horizon and flatness problems; 
                overwhelming amounts of dark matter to provide internal structure; and dark energy, whatever that might be, to explain the seemingly recent acceleration. 
                A skeptic is entitled to feel that a negative significance, after so much time, effort and trimming, 
                is nothing more than one would expect of a folktale constantly re-edited to fit inconvenient new observations.

            <p>The evidence in 2020 contorts the Big Bang model into something rather unrecognizable driven by unobserved forces and weird coincidences.</p>
            
            <hr>

            <h2>What Happened?</h2>
        
            <p>It might seem like there's no way science could be wrong about something like this, 
                but when considering the history of the idea, it's not difficult to see why things 
                turned out the way they did.</p>

            <p>To start, prior to the 1920's, we didn't know about galaxies beyond the Milky Way. 
                The part of the universe we could observe consisted of the stars closest to us, the Milky Way.
                That was about 100,000 light years across. 
                
            <p>Edwin Hubble showed in 1926 that these "nebulae" things are what we now call galaxies,
                pushing the observable region out to millions and billions of light years.</p>
                
            <p>In 1929, Hubble's redshift-distance relation was published, and many immediately interpreted this as 
                galaxies moving away from us, that could only mean the expansion of the universe.</p>

            <p>Hubble himself was never actually convinced of this. In 1937 he wrote:</p>

            <blockquote>
                <i>The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, 
                but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, 
                that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents the observable region as an 
                insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time. </i>

                <br>
                - Edwin Hubble
            </blockquote>

            <p>And in December of 1941, he announced that <a href="img/paper1941.png">he had refuted the expanding universe theory</a>.<p>

            <p>Since science doesn't exist in a vacuum, and America was entering WWII at that exact time, the telescopes and galaxies had to wait.
                Hubble was assigned to 
                <a href="https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/hubble-edwin-1889-1953">work 
                    in a wind tunnel for the war effort</a>.</p>


            <p>Once the war was over and the study of the galaxies resumed, the debate on expansion of the universe
                largely did not. Even the "Steady State Universe" that competed with the Big Bang includes the expansion of space (despite what
                one might think from its name).</p>

            <p>And ultimately, the physicists of the 20th century were completely justified in thinking the universe was expanding. 
                The evidence presented in Part 1 is from the 21st century.</p>

            <p>20th century physicists had two real options:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>space was expanding</li>
                <li>something as fundamental as inertia may not go out to infinity</li>
            </ol>

            <p>As long as option 1 seemed viable, option 2 would be far too drastic. The expansion of space seemed like a good idea, 
                which didn't require anything as crazy as putting limits on inertia. Nothing that crazy...  at first.
            </p>

            <p>The Big Bang is about 90 years old now, and a lot of crazy things have happened. Dark energy, the multiverse, CMB anomalies, oh, 
                and not being able to measure the rate of expansion accurately.</p>

            <p>Well, we have two options too.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>keep going forward on this path</li>
                <li>back up</li>
            </ol>
