            <h2>Go-Karts</h2>


            <h3>The reference frame</h3>

            <p>
                Imagine Isaac Newton has a go-kart, and he places a red apple on the track every one second. If he's traveling at a consistent 
                1 m/s, the apples will be evenly spaced 1 m apart. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" id="moving"></canvas>
            </p>

            <p>
                From Newton's frame of reference, the go-kart is not moving, and it appears as if the apples are being propelled backwards from it.
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" id="atrest"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both frames of reference are equally valid. If Newton was in a perfectly-suspended windowless enclosure on the go-kart, would he know if the kart is 
                in motion or at rest? Would he know if he was traveling in a straightline or along a gentle curve? 
            </p>

            <p>
                With those age-old questions in mind, think about the ticks of a stationary clock. On one hand, it is intuitive to think of
                the clock as moving forward in time, leaving behind a trail of spacetime events representing its ticks. The clock moves into the future, 
                leaving the past behind.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, and perhaps less intuitively, consider the view from the clock's frame of reference: it is always in the present; 
                it never leaves and the future never arrives; events that occur in the present get pushed into the past, which itself is moving away from the present. 
                To visualize this view of time, it may be helpful to imagine the observer as being on a go-kart that is on a conveyor belt moving against it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Is it possible to make a measurement or observation that would distinguish one noton of time from the other, or are they equivalent? 
                Is it possible that cosmic time dilation and redshift are evidence of one view over the other?
            </p>

            <h3>The geometry of time</h3>

            <p>
                To answer the questions of the previous section, and to provide the geometrical foundations for a hypothesis, the unusual step of 
                giving curvature to time will be taken. Note that this is not curvature in the Gaussian sense, which is the product of two principals 
                of curvature. Since time is one dimensional, it only has the opportunity to curve in one direction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The simplest example of curved time is in a circle.
                So consider Newton in his go-kart, which is placed on a circular conveyor belt that matches his speed in the opposite direction.
            </p> 
            
            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="500" id="circle"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Were Newton and the conyeor belt to take a break after an appropriate amount of time,  
                he would notice upon surveying the track that the distance to each apple from himself is no longer evenly spaced. 
                After half a rotation of the track, 
                the apple's begin to bunch together, and then start heading back toward Newton. When Newton resumes his driving, sure enough, 
                he'll see the apple's he had left behind coming toward him from the front.   
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="200" id="circle-d"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>Typically we would say that time is the real number line, or formally, that \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). 
                Here we are presented with an alternative option, where our dimension of time is on the circumference of a 2-dimensional circle, or
                \(t\in\mathbb{S}^1\), where \( \mathbb{S}^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                The distance along the curve, we'll call \(\tau\), is \(\tau = R\theta\), and the distance in the 2-d ambient space
                that Newton measures, which we'll call \(t\), is given
                by the Pythagorean theorem:
            </p>
            
            <p>\[ t^2 = (R \cos( \frac{\tau}{R}) - R)^2 + (R \sin(\frac{\tau}{R}))^2 \]</p>

            <p>In the above equation, \(t\) will be the time coordinate in the resulting dimension of time, which represents the length of a chord
                on the circle, thus preserving the distance in the ambient space.
            </p>
         <!--
                We may induce a metric for our dimension of time using the following formula:
   
            <p>\[ g_{ab}=\partial _{a}X^{\mu }\partial _{b}X^{\nu }g_{\mu \nu }\ \]</p>

            <p>where \( g_{\mu \nu } \) is the Euclidean metric in radial coordinates:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ g_{\mu \nu } =\begin{bmatrix} 1&0\\ 0&r^{2} \end{bmatrix} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Since we can convert a chord length \(l\) to an arc length using:
            </p>

            <p>\[ r\theta = 2r \arcsin (\frac{l}{2r}) \]</p>
            
            <p>Then to map the \(t\) coordinate back to the ambient space in \( (r, \theta) \) coordinates we can use: </p>

            <p>
                \[ X^{r}(t) = r \]
                \[ X^{\theta}(t) = 2 \arcsin (\frac{t}{2r}) \]
            </p>

            <p>Or, in (x, y) coordinates:</p>

            <p>
                \[ X^{x}(t) = \cos (2r \arcsin (\frac{t}{2r})) \]
                \[ X^{y}(t) = \sin (2r \arcsin (\frac{t}{2r})) \]
            </p>
            

            <p>
                \[  g_{tt} = \partial_t r \partial_t r +  (\partial_t 2 \arcsin (\frac{t}{2r}))^2 r^2 \]
                \[  g_{tt} = (\frac{2}{r \sqrt{4 - x^2/r^2}})^2 r^2  \]
            </p>
-->
            <p>
                If time is the surface of a circle as described here, the events that happen in the present will be bunched together in the past.
                This would lead to the observation of time contraction and blueshifted light. 
                Since we observe the opposite, let's apply the same reasoning to a hyperbolic track: 
            </p>
            
            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="500" id="hyperbola"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now in the ambient space, the more distant the events, the more spread out they become, which is observed as time dilation and redshift. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="800" height="200" id="hyperbola-d"></canvas></p>
            <script src="other/kart2.js"></script>


            <p>The same reasoning applies as before; our \(t\) coordinate will be the length of a chord of the hyperbola from the starting position,
                which can be found from the arc length, \(\tau\):
            </p>

            <p>
                \[t^2 = (R \cosh(\frac{\tau}{R}) - R)^2 + (R \sinh (\frac{\tau}{R}))^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>
                This function gives us the lookback time from the time given by the arc length. The arc length \(\tau\) represents time without 
                the effects of time dilation. Therefore \(c\tau\) gives you the physical distance to the source, and \(ct\) gives you the light travel time 
                distance.  
            </p>

            <p>
                At z=1, the effects of time dilation should double the duration of some kind of cosmic event. However, the lookback time will not be double. 
                This is because the light travels from z=1 to z=0 and passes all the points along the way. To find how much time dilation is occuring 
                at a certain distance, we need to find the slope of the above equation for the appropriate \(\tau\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ 1 + z = \frac{\text{d}t}{\text{d}\tau} = \frac{\cosh{\frac{3 \tau}{2 R} } }{\sqrt{\cosh{ \frac{\tau}{R}}}} \]
            </p>
                
            <p>Our measurements give us the \(t\) coordinate (the chord length), so in the cases of finding \(\tau\) (the arc length) we can use the reverse:</p>

                \[ \tau = R \cosh^{-1} \left( \frac{1}{2} \sqrt{ \frac{2t^2}{R^2} + 1} +\frac{1}{2} \right)\]
            </p>

            <!--
            <p>
                \[ X^{r}(t) = R \]
                \[ X^{\theta}(t) = \cosh^{-1} \left(\frac{R^4 + \sqrt{R^2 + 2R^2 t^2}}{2R^2} \right) \]
                \[  \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t} =-\frac{\sqrt{2} t }{  \sqrt{(R^2 + 2t^2)(|R| \sqrt{R^2 + 2t^2} - R^2 + t^2) } } \]

                It is important to note that the observer should always exist in the present, <i>t = 0</i>, in this spacetime. The desired effects only 
                occur from a frame of reference in the present.
