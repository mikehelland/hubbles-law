            <h1>Hubble's Constant and the Geometry of Time</h1>


            <h2>Observation</h2>

            <p>
                Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), is the expansion rate of the universe. The most direct pieces of evidence for the expansion of space are the 
                redshifts in light from distant galaxies, and the time dilation of distant supernovae. Light is redshifted
                when its wavelength increases, and time dilation is an increase in duration. 
                So the observations include a strethching of length, and a stretching of time. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingspace"></canvas></p>

            <p>Light, an electromagnetic wave, would also be redshifted were the wave's period to increase somehow. Since the observed duraton of a 
                distant supernovae is stretched, then it would follow that the duration of all similarly distant phenomena would be equally stretched, 
                including the oscillations of electromagnetic waves emitted from that distance.  
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Consider the interpretation that the observed redshifts are a change in the electromagnetic wave's period. 
                The evidence could then be stated as: 
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>The elongated period of an electromagnetic wave</li>
                <li>The elongated duration of supernovae</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="400" height="350" id="expandingtime"></canvas></p>

            <p>
                As a consequence of interpretting redshift like this, the two points of evidence appear fundamentally one-in-the-same, 
                with the suggestive hint that it has to do with some kind of dynamic of time, rather than of space.
            </p>

            <h2>Conjecture</h2>

            <p>
                The time dilation of supernovae is traditionally considered to be an effect of the expansion of space. Each photon coming from the supernova will 
                have to travel farther than the one before it, causing its observed duraton to be stretched.
            </p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis developed in this paper asks the reader to consider the possibility that what we are observing to happen, is actually happening. 
                Distant supernovae don't just appear time dilated; they are time dilated. The observed time dilation isn't an effect of expanding space, because 
                the expansion of space won't be necessary in a universe with time that possesses this dynamic characteristic.
                The conjecture can be summarized as <b>"the past is time dilated"</b>, and the hypothesis will be referred to as the 
                "time dilated past" (TDP) hypothesis. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="200" height="400" id="justtime"></canvas></p>
            <script src="other/evidence.js"></script>

            <p>
                The next sections describe two attempts at developing this conjecture into a testable hypothesis. First in a purely ad hoc way, and then 
                with a geometrical foundation.
            </p>

            <h2>An ad hoc solution</h2>

            <p>
                The scale factor \(a(t)\) plays a very important role in describing an expanding universe: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - c^2 dt^2 + a(t)^2 (dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2) \]
            </p>

            <p>
                And in a universe that expands very simply, such as a dark energy only universe: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[a(t) = e^{H_0t} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                As a means of exploring the conjecture, consider what happens when the scale factor is repurposed as a "time scale factor", \(b(t)\): 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ ds^2 = - b(t)^2 c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \]
                \[b(t) = e^{H_0t} = \frac{\Delta t_{then}}{\Delta t_{now}} = \frac{f_{obs}}{f_{emit}} = \frac{1}{1+z}   \]
            </p>

            <p>
                This metric form has no curvature and amounts to a transformation of the time coordinate in Minkowski spacetime. It cannot be 
                claimed to produce the effects of time dilation, or explain why it happens, which is why a geometrical solution 
                is pursued in the next section. For now, we just need to assume that the time dilation that is observed is really happening,
                and that the \(t\) coordinate measured by an observer shows those effects. Under those assumptions, we can use the following transformation
                to produce a time coordinate \(\tau\) that excludes the effects of time dilation: 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = \frac{1}{H_0} ( e^{H_0t} - 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                It is important to note that \(t = 0 \) will always represent the present, and that all the measured time 
                coordinates used will be negative since cosmological observations are dealing with the past. Therefore \(\tau \leq 0 \) too.
                This means the exponent in the equation should always be zero or negative.
            </p>

            <p>
                Distances, on the other hand, should be regarded as positive values. 
                Since \(\tau \) gives us the "un-time dilated" time coordinate, we know that the physical distance \(d\) 
                to a source of light is \(d = -c\tau \). The time scale factor in terms of redshift z can be substituted into the transformation, giving:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ \tau = (\frac{1}{1+z} - 1) \frac{1}{H_0}\]
                \[ \tau = -\frac{z}{1+z} \frac{1}{H_0}  \]
                \[ d = \frac{z}{1+z} \frac{c}{H_0} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                The light travel time distance, \(d_t = -ct \), will be longer than the physical distance due to the effects of time dilation, and 
                can be related to z by reversing the time transformation:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = e^{H_0t} \]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(H_0\tau + 1)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                And due to the time scale factor's relationship with redshift:
            </p>
            <p>
                \[ H_0\tau + 1 = \frac{1}{1+z} \]
                \[ H_0\tau = \frac{1}{1+z} - 1\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(\frac{1}{1+z} - 1 + 1)\]
                \[ t = \frac{1}{H_0} \log(\frac{1}{1+z})\]
                \[ -ct = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
                \[ d_t = \frac{c}{H_0} \log(1+z)\]
            </p>

            <p>
                In this hypothesis, \(H_0\) no longer represents the expansion rate of the universe, but still plays a familiar role in relating
                redshift to distance.
            </p>

            <h3>Compared to data</h3>

            <p>
                To test the hypothesis against the Pantheon+SH0ES dataset, a distance modulus needs to be calculated from the redshift.
                A distance modulus can be obtained from a luminosity distance, for which we will use \(-ct(1+z)\), which accounts for the effects of time 
                dilation in the flux of the light source.
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/pantheonshoes_dm.png"></p>

            <p>
                To calculate a best fit for the hypothesis to determine a value for Hubble's constant, \(H_0\), we'll use this equation for the sum 
                of squared errors (SSE):
            </p>

            <p>
                \[\chi^2= \Sigma_i (\mu_i^{d} - \mu_i^{m})^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>where \( \mu_i^d \) is the distance modulus of the i-th supernova in the dataset, and \( \mu_i^m \) is the distance modulus 
                predicted by the model from the redshift z.
                The best fit to the data is the model with the lowest SSE.
                When an SSE is calculated for the hypothesis over a range of \(H_0\), the best fit is 70.4 km/s/Mpc. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sse.png"></p>

            <p>
                The hypothesis is also shown here to be a better fit to the data than the concodrance model of cosmology, &Lambda;CDM.
                In fact, these calculations show that the hypothesis is a better fit to the supernovae data than any "flat" FLRW model 
                (\(\Omega_\Lambda + \Omega_M = 1\)), for any value of \(H_0\):
            </p>


            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/sselcdm.png"></p>

            <p>
                Although lacking a geometrical foundation, the ad hoc hypothesis is simpler than the standard model of cosmology, and it's a better 
                fit for the supernovae data, which may be of some practical value as-is. However, in the tradition of general relativity,
                a solution that arises from an underlying geometry is preferred. 
            </p>


            <h2>A geometrical solution</h2>

            <p>
                The dimension of time is commonly considered to be the real number line, \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). 
                Let's suppose the dimension of time is instead curved in a circle, perhaps something like
                \(t\in\mathbb{S}^1\), where \( \mathbb{S}^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                As time passes in circular time, events that occur at a regular interval are evenly spaced along the circle's circumference. 
                From a point on the circle, the distance to each event in the 2D space by way of the Pythagorean theorem, however, will not be 
                evenly spaced. On the other side of the circle, the events will be bunched up. Were the time that we observe acting this way, it would be 
                length contracted and light would be blueshifted. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timecircle.png"></p>

            <p>
                Since those effects are the opposite of what we observe, consider time on the surface of a hyperbola rather than a circle.
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><img src="img/timehyperbola.png"></p>
            




            <h2>Go-Karts</h2>

            <p>
                This section tries to describe the previous section with a simple exapmle. 
            </p>


            <h3>The reference frame</h3>

            <p>
                Imagine Isaac Newton has a go-kart, and he places a red apple on the track every one second. If he's traveling at a consistent 
                1 m/s, the apples will be evenly spaced 1 m apart. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" id="moving"></canvas>
            </p>

            <p>
                From Newton's frame of reference, the go-kart is not moving, and it appears as if the apples are being propelled backwards from it.
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" id="atrest"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Both frames of reference are equally valid. If Newton was in a perfectly-suspended windowless enclosure on the go-kart, would he know if the kart is 
                in motion or at rest? Would he know if he was traveling in a straightline or along a gentle curve? 
            </p>

            <p>
                With those age-old questions in mind, think about the ticks of a stationary clock. On one hand, it is intuitive to think of
                the clock as moving forward in time, leaving behind a trail of spacetime events representing its ticks. The clock moves into the future, 
                leaving the past behind.  
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, and perhaps less intuitively, consider the view from the clock's frame of reference: it is always in the present; 
                it never leaves and the future never arrives; events that occur in the present get pushed into the past, which itself is moving away from the present. 
                To visualize this view of time, it may be helpful to imagine the observer as being on a go-kart that is on a conveyor belt moving against it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Is it possible to make a measurement or observation that would distinguish one noton of time from the other, or are they equivalent? 
                Is it possible that cosmic time dilation and redshift are evidence of one view over the other?
            </p>

            <h3>The geometry of time</h3>

            <p>
                To answer the questions of the previous section, and to provide the geometrical foundations for a hypothesis, the unusual step of 
                giving curvature to time will be taken. Note that this is not curvature in the Gaussian sense, which is the product of two principals 
                of curvature. Since time is one dimensional, it only has the opportunity to curve in one direction.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                The simplest example of curved time is in a circle.
                So consider Newton in his go-kart, which is placed on a circular conveyor belt that matches his speed in the opposite direction.
            </p> 
            
            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="500" id="circle"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Were Newton and the conyeor belt to take a break after an appropriate amount of time,  
                he would notice upon surveying the track that the distance to each apple from himself is no longer evenly spaced. 
                After half a rotation of the track, 
                the apple's begin to bunch together, and then start heading back toward Newton. When Newton resumes his driving, sure enough, 
                he'll see the apple's he had left behind coming toward him from the front.   
            </p>

            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="200" id="circle-d"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>Typically we would say that time is the real number line, or formally, that \(t\in\mathbb{R}\). 
                Here we are presented with an alternative option, where our dimension of time is on the circumference of a 2-dimensional circle, or
                \(t\in\mathbb{S}^1\), where \( \mathbb{S}^1 = \{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : x^2 + y^2 = R^2 \} \).
            </p>

            <p>
                The distance along the curve, we'll call \(\tau\), is \(\tau = R\theta\), and the distance in the 2-d ambient space
                that Newton measures, which we'll call \(t\), is given
                by the Pythagorean theorem:
            </p>
            
            <p>\[ t^2 = (R \cos( \frac{\tau}{R}) - R)^2 + (R \sin(\frac{\tau}{R}))^2 \]</p>

            <p>In the above equation, \(t\) will be the time coordinate in the resulting dimension of time, which represents the length of a chord
                on the circle, thus preserving the distance in the ambient space.
            </p>
         <!--
                We may induce a metric for our dimension of time using the following formula:
   
            <p>\[ g_{ab}=\partial _{a}X^{\mu }\partial _{b}X^{\nu }g_{\mu \nu }\ \]</p>

            <p>where \( g_{\mu \nu } \) is the Euclidean metric in radial coordinates:
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ g_{\mu \nu } =\begin{bmatrix} 1&0\\ 0&r^{2} \end{bmatrix} \]
            </p>

            <p>
                Since we can convert a chord length \(l\) to an arc length using:

                If time is the surface of a circle as described here, the events that happen in the present will be bunched together in the past.
                This would lead to the observation of time contraction and blueshifted light. 
                Since we observe the opposite, let's apply the same reasoning to a hyperbolic track: 
            </p>
            
            <p class="pimg">
                <canvas width="800" height="500" id="hyperbola"></canvas>
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Now in the ambient space, the more distant the events, the more spread out they become, which is observed as time dilation and redshift. 
            </p>

            <p class="pimg"><canvas width="800" height="200" id="hyperbola-d"></canvas></p>
            <script src="other/kart2.js"></script>


            <p>The same reasoning applies as before; our \(t\) coordinate will be the length of a chord of the hyperbola from the starting position,
                which can be found from the arc length, \(\tau\):
            </p>

            <p>
                \[t^2 = (R \cosh(\frac{\tau}{R}) - R)^2 + (R \sinh (\frac{\tau}{R}))^2 \]
            </p>

            <p>
                This function gives us the lookback time from the time given by the arc length. The arc length \(\tau\) represents time without 
                the effects of time dilation. Therefore \(c\tau\) gives you the physical distance to the source, and \(ct\) gives you the light travel time 
                distance.  
            </p>

            <p>
                At z=1, the effects of time dilation should double the duration of some kind of cosmic event. However, the lookback time will not be double. 
                This is because the light travels from z=1 to z=0 and passes all the points along the way. To find how much time dilation is occuring 
                at a certain distance, we need to find the slope of the above equation for the appropriate \(\tau\). 
            </p>

            <p>
                \[ 1 + z = \frac{\text{d}t}{\text{d}\tau} = \frac{\cosh{\frac{3 \tau}{2 R} } }{\sqrt{\cosh{ \frac{\tau}{R}}}} \]
            </p>
                
            <p>Our measurements give us the \(t\) coordinate (the chord length), so in the cases of finding \(\tau\) (the arc length) we can use the reverse:</p>

                But the distance in the ambient space (ambient time?) will be the Pythagorean theorem between the (x, y) coordinates,

                It is important to note that the observer should always exist in the present, <i>t = 0</i>, in this spacetime. The desired effects only 
                occur from a frame of reference in the present.
