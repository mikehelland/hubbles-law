>"If red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, systematic variations do exist in the observable region, 
and they suggest an expanding universe that is finite, small, and young. On the other hand, if red-shifts 
are evidence of some unknown principle of nature, which does not involve actual motion, then variations 
are not appreciable in our sample, and the observable region is an insignificant fraction of the universe 
as a whole. Thus, in a certain sense, we again face a choice between a small finite universe and a 
universe indefinitely large plus a new principle of nature."

Edwin Hubble, https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept04/Hubble/paper.pdf, page 19, 1937

The computer models in this repo aim to supply that new principle of nature.

The key hypothesis is that Hubble's Law represents photon velocity v = c - H * D
