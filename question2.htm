Picture our galaxy.

And space all round it is expanding. 

The farther out in space, the faster it expands, described by Hubble's Law, v = H * D.

As light from our galaxy travels across the universe, it encounters space that 
expands faster and faster.

Eventually, distance D is so great, that H * D is greater than c, 
the speed of light. So the light gets trapped in space that is expanding faster
than it can travel. 

That means the light that gets to us has to come from closer than H/c, 
which makes an observable sphere around us, called Hubble's Volume.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble_volume

"In cosmology, a Hubble volume or Hubble sphere is a spherical region of the 
observable universe surrounding an observer beyond which objects recede from 
that observer at a rate greater than the speed of light due to the expansion of the Universe."

While we're in the center of the Hubble Volume, we're not in the center of the universe. 
So we have to assume that every other point in the universe is the center of its own Hubble Volumes.

Question 1:

At the edge of the Hubble Volume, are there large numbers of trapped photons 
that will never do anything ever except cruise in space that expands faster than it travels?

And if there are infinitely more Hubble Volumes, each with an edge with trapped photons, 
does that mean everywhere in the universe is filled with trapped photons?

----

The Cosmic Microwave Background should look the same in every direction, but after we took a closer
look, it doesn't. The southern hemisphere is a little warmer, and has a big cold spot.

Imagine an observer in a galaxy south of ours by the diameter of a Hubble Volume. 
The southern edge of our volume would touch the northern edge of their Hubble Volume.

Question 2:

How does their CMB look compared to ours? Would they see a cold spot to the south?
Or would they see the same cold spot we do by looking north?
