It's the Hubble dash

Watch three runners that all run at the same speed, but one can't keep up


#So we sabtoged the other two


One will find the finish line has a mind of its own
And the other is running against a clock that has a mind of it own



go



It looks like the blue runner is out in font, but their finish line is moving awayyyyy

The red runner has a chance to win but their clock is starting to spin out of control

When the final results come in, all clocks read the same.


It's a tie










How could that happen? Do you happen to have to any further analysis?

Why yes I do.

The expanding track of the blue runner increased the length between steps.

That can't be good

But the time between the steps of the other runners increased too

Also not good

But also not good equally.

-----

The length and time between steps can be used to calculte reshifts for the runners.
