The CMB is an almost perfect emission of blackbody thermal radiation at approx. 2.7 K. Emission equals absorption according to Kirchoff’s law for radiation. The Stefan—Boltzmann law tells us that a perfect emitter emits 𝑗⋆=𝜎𝑇4 watts per square meter, where 𝜎=5.67×10−8 W/m2/K4 is the Stefan—Boltzmann constant and 𝑇 is the temperature. Plugging in 2.7 K yields about three microwatts per square meter. So this is also what a perfect absorber, bathed in 2.7 K

thermal radiation, absorbs.

Of course the Earth is a big place, and the whole Earth receives as much as a gigawatt of CMB radiation. But for comparison, solar irradiation is about 1370 W/m2
, more than a billion times the power of the CMB.
