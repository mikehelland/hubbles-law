 Lelli et al. (1) report a galaxy that had evolved features (both a disk and a bulge) when only 1.2 billion years had elapsed since 
 the Big Bang (∼12.5 billion years ago) (see the figure). This finding suggests that the processes that generate the key features 
 of a mature galaxy arose more rapidly than has been thought.

A massive stellar bulge in a regularly rotating galaxy 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang

Cosmological models predict that galaxies forming in the early Universe experience a chaotic phase of gas accretion and star formation, 
followed by gas ejection due to feedback processes. Galaxy bulges may assemble later via mergers or internal evolution. Here we present 
submillimeter observations (with spatial resolution of 700 parsecs) of ALESS 073.1, a starburst galaxy at redshift z≃5 when the Universe 
was 1.2 billion years old. This galaxy’s cold gas forms a regularly rotating disk with negligible noncircular motions. The galaxy 
rotation curve requires the presence of a central bulge in addition to a star-forming disk. We conclude that massive bulges and regularly 
rotating disks can form more rapidly in the early Universe than predicted by models of galaxy formation.

The existence of such a massive, rotationally supported, cold disk galaxy when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old favours formation through either cold-mode accretion or mergers, although its large rotational velocity and large content of cold gas remain challenging to reproduce with most numerical simulations

"To complicate things further, if massive galaxies are unexpectedly dustier in the early Universe than astronomers predict then even UltraVISTA wouldn't be able to detect them. If this is indeed the case, the currently-held picture of how galaxies formed in the early Universe may also require a complete overhaul."

"If you look at the galaxies in the early universe, there is a lot of neutral hydrogen that is not transparent to this emission," says Zitrin. "We expect that most of the radiation from this galaxy would be absorbed by the hydrogen in the intervening space. Yet still we see Lyman-alpha from this galaxy."

Old-looking galaxy in a young universe: Astronomers find dust in the early universe

The galaxy
is highly evolved: it has a large stellar mass, and is heavily en-
riched in dust, with a dust-to-gas ratio close to that of the Milky
Way. Dusty, evolved galaxies are thus present among the fainter
star-forming population at z > 7, in spite of the very short time
since they first appeared.

Fifteen mature galaxies were found at a record-breaking average distance of 12 billion light years, when the universe was just 1.6 billion years old. Their existence at such an early time raises new questions about what forced them to grow up so quickly

The newly classified galaxies are striking in that they look a lot like those in today's universe, with disks, bars and spiral arms. But theorists predict that these should have taken another 2 billion years to begin to form, so things seem to have been settling down a lot earlier than expected.
