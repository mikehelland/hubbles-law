1999 ?13.4 billion years
Australian Charles Lineweaver of the University of New South Wales
calculated that the age of the universe is 13.4 billion plus/minus 1.6
billion. The calculation are based on young, independent observations
from which US researchers around Nehta Bahcall of the Princeton
university (new Jersey) newly calculated the form and extension speed.

2001 ? 12.5 billion 
February 7, 2001, Roger Cayrel et al  measured amounts of the radioactive
elements thorium and uranium in an ancient star named CS31082-001
using a technique called radioactive cosmochronometry. "The ages of the
oldest stars in the galaxy indicate when star formation began and provide a
minimum age for the universe," Cayrel said. They calculated that
CS31082-001 is about 12.5 billion years old, with an error factor of
about
three billion years.
