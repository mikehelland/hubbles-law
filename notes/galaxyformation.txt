A massive stellar bulge in a regularly rotating galaxy 1.2 billion years after the Big Bang
https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abc1893
The authors found that the galaxy contains a massive stellar bulge and a regularly rotating disk, features that models predict take billions of years to form. These results indicate that galaxy evolution is a more rapid process than previously thought.

To complicate things further, if massive galaxies are unexpectedly dustier in the early Universe than astronomers predict then even UltraVISTA wouldn't be able to detect them. If this is indeed the case, the currently-held picture of how galaxies formed in the early Universe may also require a complete overhaul.

"Finally, I review how observables of galaxies, and the observed galaxy formation process, compares with predictions from simulations of galaxy formation, finding significant discrepancies in the abundances of massive galaxies and the merger history. I conclude by examining prospects for the future using JWST, Euclid, SKA, and the ELTs in addressing outstanding issues"
