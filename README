Space is expanding. 

Supposedly. 

We think this because we assume light travels to infinity and never loses energy,
but we observe that the more distant a galaxy is, the more energy of its light has been lost.

Rather than questioning light's role in this situation, we theorize that space is expanding,
and everything is moving away from us, which causes the light to have lower energy levels.
 
Here's what Edwin Hubble had to say in 1937:

"If red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, systematic variations do exist in the observable region, 
and they suggest an expanding universe that is finite, small, and young. On the other hand, if red-shifts 
are evidence of some unknown principle of nature, which does not involve actual motion, then variations 
are not appreciable in our sample, and the observable region is an insignificant fraction of the universe 
as a whole. Thus, in a certain sense, we again face a choice between a small finite universe and a 
universe indefinitely large plus a new principle of nature."

The computer models in this repo aim to supply that new principle of nature.

Specifically, the preferred model is one where light redshifts until it reaches zero and is done. 
Light is given a finite range which is Hubble's Distance, `c / H`.
