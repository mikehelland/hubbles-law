Hubble's Dilemma: Notes on _The Observational Approach to Cosmology_ 

It is well known today that our sun is a star in the Milky Way galaxy and there are billions of galaxies in the universe. But in 1920, that wasn't known at all. By anyone. 

We hadn't looked out past our galaxy yet, so we didn't need the idea of a galaxy. The universe was space filled with stars.

In the 1920's that changed. The man credited with the discovery of galaxies is Edwin Hubble, who wrote in 1937:

"As late as fifteen years ago the observable region was restricted to our own system of stars, the system of the Milky Way. Since that time great reflectors have identified the nebulae as independent stellar systems, the true inhabitants of space. Explorations, using the nebulae as gigantic landmarks, have swept out beyond the Milky Way to the very limits of existing telescopes. The observable region, our sample of the universe, has been suddenly magnified a million million fold."

This quote comes from the preface of _The Observational Approach to Cosmology_, a book containing several lectures about the discovery of galaxies and their features.

Throughout the book he refers to a particular dilemma, a choice between a small and young universe, or an indefinitely large and old universe plus a new principle of nature. Here are some excerpts, emphasis mine:

The features, however, include the phenomena of red-shifts whose significance is still uncertain. Alternative interpretations are possible, and, while they introduce only minor differences in the picture of the observable region, they lead to totally different conceptions of the universe itself. One conception, at the moment, seems less plausible than the other, but this dubious world, the expanding universe of relativistic cosmology, is derived from the more likely of the two interpretations of red-shifts. Thus the discussion ends in a dilemma, and the resolution must await improved observations or improved theory or both.

The conclusions are tentative but they are none the less impressive, for once again, as in the days of Copernicus, we seem to face a choice between a finite, small-scale universe and a universe indefinitely large plus **a new principle of nature**.

The third feature, which will be discussed at length in the next lecture, is the law of red-shifts - **the observed fact that light from a distant nebula loses energy in proportion to the distance it travels** from the nebula to the observer.


Page 19

To anticipate, the investigations lead to alternative pictures, depending upon the alternative possible interpretations of red-shifts. If red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, systematic variations do exist in the observable region, and they suggest an expanding universe that is finite, small, and young. On the other hand, if red-shifts are evidence of some unknown principle of nature, which does not involve actual motion, then variations are not appreciable in our sample, and the observable region is an insignificant fraction of the universe as a whole. Thus, in a certain sense, we again face a choice between a small finite universe and a universe indefinitely large plus **a new principle of nature**.

When first observed the red-shifts were immediately attributed to radial motion away from the observer, to recession of the nebulae. This interpretation still remains the only permissible explanation that is known. It is true that other ways are known by which red-shifts might be produced, but in each case they would be accompanied by other phenomena which would be conspicuous and, actually, are not found. We may state with some confidence that red-shifts are the familiar velocity-shifts, or else **they represent some unrecognized principle  of nature**. We cannot assume that our knowledge of physical principles is yet complete; nevertheless, we should not replace a known, familiar principle by an ad hoc explanation unless we are forced to that step by  actual observations. 

Most of the theoretical investigators adopt this point of view, and accept without question the interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts. They are fully justified in their position until evidence to the contrary is forthcoming. But these lectures will present a remarkable situation. The familiar interpretation of red-shifts seems to imply a strange and dubious universe, very young and very small. On the other hand, the plausible and, in a sense, familiar conception of a universe extending indefinitely in space and time, a universe vastly greater than the observable region, seems to imply that red-shifts are not primarily velocity-shifts. In view of this possible conflict, whether of facts or theories or speculations, the observer is inclined to keep an open mind and to adopt parallel working hypotheses for the interpretation of his explorations. He may assume, first, that red-shifts are velocity-shifts, or, secondly, that **red-shifts result from some unknown principle that does not involve actual motion**, and always, of course, he will search for some empirical, critical test for distinguishing between the two assumptions, between motion and no motion.

Because of this relation an increase in wave-length implies a decrease in E, or, we may-say, a reduction of E implies an increase in wave-length. In either case we observe only the increased wave-length, and we have no direct way of determining which of the two effects is fundamental. If the primary change is in the wave-length, then red-shifts are probably velocity-shifts. **But the primary change might possibly be a loss of energy, which we would observe as a red-shift**. In the latter case the law of red-shifts would be fully described by the simple statement that **light loses energy in proportion to the distance it travels through space**.

Now the red-shifts observed in nebular spectra behave as velocity-shifts behave - the fractional shift dw / w is constant throughout a given spectrum - and they are readily expressed as velocities of recession. The scale is so convenient that it is widely used, even by those **cautious observers who prefer to speak of `apparent velocities' rather than actual motion**. For instance, the law of red-shifts is frequently called the 'velocity-distance relation'. 

Red-Shifts as Loss of Energy in Transit

Well, perhaps the nebulae are all receding in this peculiar manner. But the notion is rather startling. The cautious observer naturally examines other possibilities before accepting the proposition even as a working hypothesis. He recalls the alternative formulation of the law of red-shifts - **light loses energy 'in proportion to the distance it travels through space**. The law, in this form, sounds quite plausible. Internebular space, we believe, cannot. be entirely empty. There must be a gravitational field through which the light-quanta travel for many millions of years before they reach the observer, and there may be some interaction between the quanta and the surrounding medium. The problem invites speculation, and, indeed, has been carefully examined. But no satisfactory, detailed solution has been found. The known reactions have been examined, one after the other - and they have failed to account for the observations. **Light may lose energy during its journey through space, but if so, we do not yet know how the loss can be explained**. 

The observer seems to face a dilemma. The familiar interpretation of red-shifts leads to rather startling conclusions. These conclusions can be avoided by an assumption which sounds plausible but which finds no place in our present body of knowledge. The situation can be described as follows. Red-shifts are produced either in the nebulae, where the light originates, or in the intervening space through which the light travels. If the source is in the nebulae, then red-shifts are probably velocity-shifts and the nebulae are receding. If the source lies in the intervening space, the explanation of red-shifts is unknown but the nebulae are sensibly stationary. 

Page 30

The implications of this result are important. If red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, **light loses energy strictly in proportion to the distance it travels through space**. As light streams in from the remote nebulae in all directions, each million years of the light-paths subtracts the same fraction of energy from the quanta. We may not know how the reduction is accomplished, but we do know that the action is everywhere uniform. Within the small uncertainties of the measures the sample of the universe that can be explored with spectrographs is thoroughly homogeneous. 

Page 47

The familiar interpretation of red-shifts as velocity-shifts very seriously restricts not only the time scale, the age of the universe, but the spatial dimensions as well. On the other hand, the alternative possible interpretation, that red-shifts are not velocity-shifts, avoids both difficulties, and presents **the observable region as an insignificant sample of a universe that extends indefinitely in space and in time**. 

Page 48

The disturbing features are all introduced by the recession factors, by the assumption that red shifts are velocity-shifts. The departure from a linear law of red-shifts, the departure from uniform distribution, the curvature necessary to restore homogeneity, the excess material demanded by the curvature, each of these is merely the recession factor in another form. These elements identify a unique model among the array of possible expanding worlds, and, in this model, the restriction in the time-scale, the limitation of the spatial dimensions, the amount of unobserved material, is each equivalent to the recession factor. 

On the other hand, **if the recession factor is dropped, if red-shifts are not primarily velocity-shifts, the picture is simple and plausible. There is no evidence of expansion and no restriction of the time-scale**, no trace of spatial curvature, and no limitation of spatial dimensions. Moreover, there is no problem of internebular material. The observable region is thoroughly homogeneous; it is too small a sample to indicate the nature of the universe at large

Page 52

Two pictures of the universe are sharply drawn. Observations, at the moment, seem to favour one picture, but they do not rule out the other. We seem to face, as once before in the days of Copernicus, a choice between a small, finite universe, and **a universe indefinitely large plus a new principle of nature**.
