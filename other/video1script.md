Time Delays and Hubble's Law

Hubble's law introduces time delays in light signals between distant galaxies.

To demonstrate that, here's a model of a photon traveling past a series of targets 100 million light years apart.




It will take a photon 1 year to travel 1 light year, and 2 years to travel 2 light years.

If that continued on forever, the time t it would take a photon to reach a distance d would be a line, t = d.

But it doesn't continue on forever, due to the expansion of space.

Everything is moving away from everything, at speed of v=HD, and it just takes longer to get around.

To calculate those delays, here's a little computer program.

We'll model a photon traveling in space past a series of targets, 100 million light years apart.



Here's a little computer program to calcualte those time delays.
