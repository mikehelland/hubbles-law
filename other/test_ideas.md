<h3>Test 4: breadcrumbs</h3> 

<p>If the photon has less energy when it arrives than when it left, what about the missing energy? 
    If the universe were trillions of trillions of years old, and light kept losing energy all over the place, you would think there would be barely
    anything left in existence by now.
</p>

<p>For this reason, it seems sensible that any energy deducted from the photon during its journey through space might be deposited along its path, 
    like a trail of breadcrumbs. Overtime, this discarded energy could coalesce into something larger.
</p>

<p>This might be supported by observations of walls and filaments of galaxies:</p>

    An analysis of thousands of galaxies finds that they are strung like pearls on a necklace, even on relatively small scales.

        On large scales, the universe is comprised of empty voids, punctuated by narrow, winding filaments of dark matter that guide the growth of galaxies and galaxy clusters. This cosmic web, which has taken decades to map, holds a repeating pattern on the order of hundreds of millions of light years.

<p>Although, how that could be made into a quantifiable prediction is presently unclear.</p>

<h3>Test 4: Close range redshift</h3>

<p>While hypothesis 1 predicts the same redshifts as the expanding model, hypothesis 2 shows us something a little different. 
    The redshifts predicted by hypothesis seem to have a late start, which we can see by zooming into the first few billion years of the graph.

</p>

<p>The green and white lines can be made by either hypothesis 1 or the expanding model. 
    Green is for H = 74 km/s/Mpc, and white is for H = 67 km/s/Mpc. The red line represents hypothesis 2.</p>

<p>As you can see from the red line, it has a slower start than the other models. There is very little redshift for the first billion years.</p>

<p>Then hypothesis 2 comes back and catches up to the green line, H = 74 km/s/Mpc. It follows the green line for a bit, 
    before jumping over to the white line, H = 67 km/s/Mpc. Then it does its own thing and flattens out.</p>

<p>work in progress</p>
