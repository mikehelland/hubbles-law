    </a><sup>[7]</sup>

    <blockquote>
        The existence of such a massive, rotationally supported, cold disk galaxy when the Universe was only 1.5 billion years old favours formation through either cold-mode accretion or mergers, although its large rotational velocity and large content of cold gas remain challenging to reproduce with most numerical simulations.

        <blockquote>
            In most galaxy formation scenarios, galaxies only start to show a well-formed disk around 6 billion years after the Big Bang.
            <br>
            <br>
            The fact that the team found such a disk galaxy when the Universe was only 10% of its current age, indicates that other growth processes must have dominated.
            <br>
            <br>
            “We think the Wolfe Disk has grown primarily through the steady accretion of cold gas,” Dr. Prochaska said.
            <br>
            <br>
            “Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.”

        "To complicate things further, if massive galaxies are unexpectedly dustier in the early Universe than astronomers predict then even UltraVISTA wouldn't be able to detect them. If this is indeed the case, the currently-held picture of how galaxies formed in the early Universe may also require a complete overhaul."

    "If you look at the galaxies in the early universe, there is a lot of neutral hydrogen that is not transparent to this emission," says Zitrin.

        The newly classified galaxies are striking in that they look a lot like those in today's universe, with disks, bars and spiral arms. But theorists predict that these should have taken another 2 billion years to begin to form, so things seem to have been settling down a lot earlier than expected.
